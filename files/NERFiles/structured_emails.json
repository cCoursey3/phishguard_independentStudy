Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMay 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and 2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAugust 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and 2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which for me should have been around  $112,625.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend.\r\n\r\nMegan",

If we have to wait until after break for the follow up it would be better to just stick with the original dates of Dec 20 and 21. Are those still free? If not, do you have an earlier follow up slot? That way Hayden could possibly do his follow up over xmas break and not miss school for that.\r\n \r\nIf Dec 20 and 21 are no longer available could you just give me a call? That will probably be easiest given how complicated this is.\r\n \r\nThanks\r\nMegan ",

He has been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why. Apparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic rigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was diagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing to be sure we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t missing anything else. I will keep you updated.\r\n \r\nRegarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go to a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to go for his exams?\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMegan Coursey\r\n \r\nSent from my iPhone",

Then we'll check into The Historic Powhatan, a residences resort with amenities including: indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, tennis and racquetball courts, and a mini-golf course.\r\n\r\nSaturday will be devoted to Water Country USA, Virginia's largest water park -- wave pools, lazy rivers, water coasters, live entertainment, and more! We'll call it quits when the park closes at 7pm and return to The Historic Powhatan for one more night before our departure on Sunday morning. \r\n\r\nIncluding transportation, two nights at The Historic Powhatan, a half day at Colonial Williamsburg, and a full day at Water Country USA, this trip is available to UHP students at the low cost of $95. If this trip sounds like something you absolutely must add to your summer, please fill out this google form.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a great week!\r\n\r\n--\r\nMorgan Budzynski (she/her)\r\nNorth Carolina State University\r\nM.A. in Rhetoric and Composition C/O 2025\r\nAdministrative Assistant, University Honors Program",

These are opportunities for students to engage in experiential learning outside the classroom in a way that directly aligns with their individual goals. This requirement also gives students the opportunity to reflect on how these experiences impact their learning in preparation for life after college such as graduate school or employment applications.\r\n\r\nThis email is meant to serve as a gentle reminder that if you completed what would qualify as a High Impact Experience at any point during this academic school year, it is preferred you submit your reflection essay for that HIE before we get very far into the summer months. DO NOT stress over writing these reflections before your final exams are over, but please do submit them sometime soon after! Ideally, going forward, we would like students to submit their reflections within the same semester that their HIE concluded (within 4-6 weeks) so that the experience is still fresh in their minds and they have plenty of details to share in their reflection essay.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINARY BREADTH EXCEPTION: the exception to the above \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeadline guideline\u00e2\u0080\u009d of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithin 4-6 weeks of the experience concluding\u00e2\u0080\u009d is our \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisciplinary Breadth\u00e2\u0080\u009d category. If a student is double majoring or majoring and minoring in academic programs from two different academic colleges, we would rather you wait until the semester of your graduation to reflect on what studying under those differing academic programs has done for you as a person and future professional. \r\n\r\nAn explanation of the High Impact Experience requirement has always been linked on our website, but we have also recently recorded a short (4:19) video, linked below with a transcript, to better explain the HIE requirement and the various HIE categories under which students can submit their HIE reflections.\r\n\r\nSince this video was recorded, an additional slide has been added to the HIEs Explained slide deck with some examples of professional and/or personally developmental opportunities available to students from around the University that would definitely qualify as a High Impact Experience upon successful completion.\r\n\r\nHONORS CAPSTONE PROJECT : Remember that students who submit their undergraduate research as an Honors Capstone Project can earn two out of their three required High Impact Experiences at once!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the High Impact Experience requirement for the Honors Program, please reach out to your Honors Program advisor.\r\n\r\nTo submit a High Impact Experience reflection essay, please use this Google Form. \r\n\r\n \r\nWatch the Video (4:19) + Read the Transcript arrow\r\n \r\n \r\nFacebook\r\nFacebook\r\nInstagram\r\nInstagram\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n--\r\nUniversity Honors Program\r\nNC State University\r\nUniversity College, Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA)\r\n221 Jensen Drive, #219 Clark Hall\r\nCampus Box 8610\r\nRaleigh, NC 27695\r\nP: 919-515-2353\r\nF: 919-513-4392\r\nhonors.dasa.ncsu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvisor\t       Advisees\r\nAnne Auten\tLast names beginning with A-Cn\r\nSean Cassidy\tLast names beginning with Co-Gra\r\nKen Johnson\tLast names beginning with Grb-Lar\r\nSean Cassidy\tLast names beginning with Las-Pan\r\nMeghan Teten\tLast names beginning with Pao-Sie\r\nEmily Koester\tLast names beginning with Sif-Z\r\n\r\n\"All electronic mail messages in connection with State business that are sent to or received by this account are subject to the NC Public Records Law.

If he is not one of your students, I apologize and hope you can redirect me accordingly.\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure this is unusual, but I want to ask if it would even be possible for him to take his exam at least later in the day. He is sick with what I believe is the flu. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been tending to him for a bit and he is having HORRIBLE muscle fatigue, sweats, pains, etc. All classic signs of the flu. I came over after he took an exam this morning and he told me how bad he was doing and that he had no pain meds for his headache. As his partner I came to help him. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been on his bedside changing a cool cloth every few minutes because his temperature keeps causing it to heat up so quickly. Unfortunately he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a thermometer where he lives so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even send formal proof of his state. \r\n\r\nI told him to try and reach out earlier but he assured me there was no way his exam could be considered for a later time. However, considering the increased emphasis on student health physically and mentally, I was hoping you would consider, if nothing else, allowing him to take the exam at a different hour. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you can conclude, being this sick and worrying about an 8:30 am exam is not ideal for the healing process.\r\n\r\nI do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause or disrespect this may come across as on my part, but I want what is best for him and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m confident an exam tomorrow is not that, much less at 8:30 in the morning.\r\n\r\nI did not copy him on this email because I did not want his hopes to get up; plus I know him and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably try to tough it out instead of risking offending a professor. I hope you will consider what I am suggesting.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChloe Coursey",

However, since it is a new house there is no wifi set up, but the wifi should be set up later today (the 28th) as a router and modem is coming  in the mail. i recognize i had the capabilities to finish my webassign assignments before now and I could have emailed earlier than this but with all the move in chaos I honestly forgot to email you about this and lost track of time as I had hopes to finish my syllabus quiz prelab and postlab before now. I am going to request an extension via webassign although I am not sure if i can do that now that the due time has passed. Regardless, I am very sorry for the late notice and this won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen again. I am normally very on top of my work and I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what happened here. I apologize for this inconvenience but still hope you will grant me an extension (although I understand if you deny the request).\r\n\r\nAgain, I am very sorry for this,\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nChloe Coursey",

This includes the week of April 6th.\r\n\r\nDue to the importance of social distancing, the government has relaxed many of the rules regarding telehealth visits, and we can now treat some patients via telephone calls or 2-way video conferences during our office hours of 9:00am-1:00pm.  This includes Medicare, Maryland Medicaid, and many commercial insurances (BCBS, Aetna, Cigna, United, to name a few).  If you call our office the doctor on staff will determine if you are a candidate for a telehealth visit.  If so, under the new guidelines, we will bill your insurance for the visit and are waiving your copay.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.

One that goes everywhere your little one goes?\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLoveys\u00e2\u0080\u009d help your baby to learn how to self-comfort.

Having another baby isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just an emotional commitment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a physical one. Pregnancy and childbirth have profound effects on the body, and full recovery can take several months. Recent research suggests that mothers should wait 12 months between childbirth and a new pregnancy to protect themselves and the future baby from serious health complications.\r\n\r\nThat said, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what to keep in mind if you plan to get pregnant once your baby turns 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThink you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the master of all things \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaby\u00e2\u0080\u009d?

All babies develop at their own pace and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a range of time for each milestone. But if you notice these signs of potential developmental delay in your 1-year-old, let the healthcare provider know (the earlier it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addressed, the better): \r\n\r\nDoes not crawl\r\nCannot stand, even when supported\r\nDoes not look for things after seeing you hide them\r\nDoes not say any single words, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmama\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdada\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nDoes not learn gestures, such as waving or head shaking\r\nDoes not point to things\r\nLoses previously achieved skills \r\nOn Your Mind Today?\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The first dentist appointment\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Can you discipline a baby? \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Is your baby manipulating you? \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bringing your baby to a wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nWorried that your baby could have a peanut allergy because it runs in your family?

This opportunity is designed to provide financial assistance to students who might be facing some financial challenges, while also giving them the chance to gain some invaluable research experience.\r\n\r\nThese internships are completely remote! That means you can work from the comfort of your own home or even on-campus if you prefer. The time commitment is pretty chill too, with a maximum requirement of just seven hours a week. Plus, the schedules are super flexible, so you can easily fit them around your other commitments.\r\n\r\nIf you're chosen for one of these internships, you will receive a weekly salary of Three Hundred and Fifty dollars\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like an opportunity you don't want to miss, all you need to do is reach out to Professor Jay Aronson at aronsonjjay@gmail.com [mailto:aronsonjjay@gmail.com] with your full Names, year of study, department, school email address and alternative email address (preferably Gmail) for details about the job description and any additional application requirements.\r\n\r\nOh, and one more thing: these positions are filled on a first-come, first-served basis. So don't waste any time and get that email sent ASAP!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nOffice of the Department of History\r\nCarnegie Mellon University.",

I wanted to inform you that I recently received an internship offer from a company I interviewed with last month, and I have accepted the offer. Unfortunately, this means that I will no longer be participating in the GCSP-REU program this summer. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would still love to be a panelist for the GCSP-REU Welcome event on 5/20 if you are looking for someone to help. Please let me know if this is something you would like me to do, and I would be more than happy to assist in any way I can.\r\n\r\nWishing you luck running the program this summer!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCN",

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your guidance and support throughout the course. Your insights have been invaluable to my learning experience. Thank you once again.\r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n\r\nMicrocontrollers I - Spring 2024\r\n\r\nFINAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nQ1: Describe in 1 or 2 sentences what each of these Arduino functions or operators do:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrandom(min, max): Generates pseudo-random numbers. It returns a random number between min and max-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelay(): Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as a parameter. It is useful for creating\r\n longer delays where timing precision is not critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelayMicroseconds(): This function pauses the program for the specified number of microseconds. It is useful for creating\r\n very short delays, especially when working with timing-sensitive components (i.e. sensors or communication protocols).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmicros(): Returns the number of microseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillis():  Returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanalogWrite(): generates a PWM signal on a specified pin, allowing control over the output voltage level, which is\r\n useful for controlling the brightness of an LED, the speed of a motor, or the position of a servo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!=  (example: x != y): stands for \"not equal to\" and is used to compare two values. The expression x != y evaluates\r\n to \u00e2\u0080\u0098true\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if x is not equal to y, and \u00e2\u0080\u0098false\u00e2\u0080\u0099 otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n%:\r\nCalculates the remainder when one integer is divided by another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&&: It is the logical AND operator used to combine two conditions. It returns true if both conditions it connects\r\n are true, and false\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==: Compares the left variable with the right value or variable in the operator, returning \u00e2\u0080\u0098true\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if they are equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=: \r\nIt is the assignment operator used to assign a value to a variable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEEPROM.put():\r\nWrites values to the EEPROM using variable semantics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEEPROM.get():\r\nRetrieves values from EEPROM so that we can print them as floats on the serial monitor using Serial.print()\r\nor Serial.println() \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ2: For the millis() function, how long will the counter run before it overflows (reaches its maximum then starts counting again from zero)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe counter is an \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsigned long\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type, which means it can hold values from\r\n0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1). This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately\r\n50 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ3: For the micros() function, how long will the counter run before it overflows (reaches its maximum then starts counting again from zero)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe counter is an \u00e2\u0080\u0098unsigned long\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type, which means it can hold values from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1). This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately\r\n71.6 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ4: For the analogWrite() function, using your Arduino Uno, what are the PWM frequencies that you would get on the analog output pins?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arduino Uno's analogWrite() function uses PWM on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. The PWM frequency on most pins is around\r\n490 Hz, while pins 5 and 6 have a frequency of around\r\n980 Hz. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ5: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type \"int\":\r\n\r\n - How many bytes are stored in an \"int\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 2 bytes in an \u00e2\u0080\u009cint\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\n\r\n\r\n - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in an int?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minimum value that can be stored is -32,768,\r\n and the maximum value is 32,767 in an int.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ6: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type \"float\":\r\n\r\n - How many bytes are stored in a \"float\"? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 4 bytes in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloat\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\n\r\n\r\n - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in a float?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfloat\u00e2\u0080\u009d data type can represent a wide range of values. The minimum value that can be stored in a float is -3.4028235E+38 and\r\n the maximum value is 3.4028235E+38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ7: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type \"unsigned int\":\r\n\r\n - How many bytes are stored in an \"unsigned int\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 2 bytes in an \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsigned int\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\n\r\n\r\n - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in an unsigned int?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minimum value that can be stored in an unsigned int is\r\n0, and the maximum value is\r\n65,535.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ8: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type \"long\":\r\n\r\n - How many bytes are stored in a \"long\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 4 bytes in \u00e2\u0080\u009clong\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\n\r\n\r\n - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in a long?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minimum value that can be stored in a long is\r\n-2,147,483,648, and the maximum value is\r\n2,147,483,647.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ9: Many Arduino circuits are built using a solderless breadboard. These can cause problems. Describe at least one major problem that can be caused by using a solderless breadboard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolderless breadboards can cause problems with complex circuits because of the large amount of wiring required. A major issue with solderless breadboards is their less secure connections compared to\r\n soldered ones, which can lead to unreliable circuit behavior especially with high-frequency or high-current circuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ10:\r\n\r\nWhat is an \"internal pullup\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn \"internal pullup\" is a resistor that can be internally connected to a digital input pin in an Arduino. It pulls the pin's voltage to HIGH (5V) when the pin is not actively driven LOW (0V), helping\r\n maintain a defined voltage level on the pin in the absence of an external circuit. This prevents floating inputs and reduces electrical noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you use it (how do you activate it)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo activate the internal pullup resistor, you use the\r\npinMode()\r\nfunction with the mode INPUT_PULLUP. For example,\r\npinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat command is used by Arduino to activate an internal pullup?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does it do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe INPUT_PULLUP mode in Arduino sets a digital pin to the HIGH level by connecting an internal resistor between the digital pin and the power supply (VCC). This pull-up resistor typically has a value\r\n of around 20-50 k\u00ce\u00a9 and helps prevent floating inputs, which can lead to high current consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy would you use it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn internal pullup is used to simplify circuit design by removing the necessity for an external resistor to pull a digital input pin to the HIGH level. This is particularly useful when connecting switches\r\n or buttons that are normally open, as the internal pullup resistor ensures a stable HIGH state when the switch or button is not pressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ11: To find answers to questions you may have in the future, for further learning, or to see new project Ideas, list at least three resources that are freely available to you:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArduino Forum: The forum is helpful for seeking answers to Arduino-related questions and discovering fresh project\r\n ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChatGPT:\r\nIt's a useful tool for debugging code and getting answers to various questions, although its accuracy may vary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClassmates:\r\nOther students in the class could offer insights and solutions to common problems, making them a great resource for addressing questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoutube: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rich source of tutorials and project demonstrations for Arduino enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ12: Think of a medical or health-related device that you could build using a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Describe the device, what it is useful for, and how it would work, with a brief discussion of the features you would use to make the device function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA medical device that I could build using a microcontroller such as an Arduino is the\r\nFinger Pulse Oximeter.\r\nIt is used to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. The device uses LEDs to emit light through a finger, which is then measured by a photodetector to determine the SpO2 and calculate\r\n the heart rate. The microcontroller controls the LEDs, reads the photodetector signal, processes the data to calculate SpO2 and heart rate, and displays the results on a screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEDs: Emit light at specific wavelengths (usually red) to penetrate the skin and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotodetector: Detect the light transmitted through the finger and convert it into an electrical signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSignal Processing: Algorithms to process the photodetector signal and calculate SpO2 and heart rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Cindy Nguyen <tqnguye6@ncsu.edu>\r\nSent: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 2:48 AM\r\nTo: bob bobslab.com <bob@bobslab.com>\r\nCc: bob@unc.edu <bob@unc.edu>; Cindy Nguyen <tqnguye6@ncsu.edu>\r\nSubject: BME 375 Final Exam - Cindy Nguyen \r\nDisplay: Show the measured SpO2 and heart rate values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUser Interface: Buttons or a touchscreen to control the device and navigate menus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPower Supply: Battery or external power source to power the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Alternatively, an oximeter sensor such as the MAX30101 by SparkFun can be used in replacement of the LEDs and the photodetector. The MAX30101 performs sensing by using its internal LEDs to bounce light off the arteries and arterioles in the finger's subcutaneous layer, while its photodetectors sense how much light is absorbed. \r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCindy N.",

During this period, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but \u00d0\u00ben\u00d0\u00b5 is of special significance to me.\r\n \r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial \u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00bern videos. Given that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cquestionable\u00e2\u0080\u009d genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick \u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00b5rv\u00d0\u00b5rsi\u00d0\u00ben.\r\n \r\nI doubt you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.\r\n \r\nEvery number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vid\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email \u00e2\u0080\u0093 everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your f\u00d0\u00berm\u00d0\u00b5r life.\r\n \r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your \u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00b5rv\u00d0\u00b5rsi\u00d0\u00ben might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved \u00d1\u0080unishm\u00d0\u00b5nt to stop you.\r\n \r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my m\u00d0\u00b5r\u00d1\u0081y is not free.\r\n \r\nTransfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0\r\n \r\nOnce I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will \u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00b5rmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninst\u00d0\u00b0ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.\r\n \r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very simple. Just google \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrypto exchange\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \"buy Litecoin\" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.\r\n \r\nI strongly warn you against the following:\r\n* Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.\r\n* Do not contact the police. I have access to all your d\u00d0\u00b5vi\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b5s, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.\r\n* Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to reset or destroy your d\u00d0\u00b5vi\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b5s. As I mentioned above: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vid\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bes are \u00d1\u0080ublished.\r\n \r\nAlso, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to identify me using the provided \u00d0\u00b0ddr\u00d0\u00b5ss.\r\n \r\nGood luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.\r\nAnd some friendly advice: from now on, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so careless about your online security.",

I give individual and gathering treatment as well as training, evaluation, and scholastic screenings to help understudies with physical and mental handicaps, among others enrolled with the DHHS.\r\nAn enormous level of the understudies served by this psychological well-being unit have mental or co-horrible mental inabilities and need emotional wellness backing to find lasting success at the college. Accordingly, the unit gives the expected emotional well-being support while seeing and surveying undiscovered college understudies with scholastic hardships through the scholarly screening and evaluation process. Close to that, I am the overseer of the management, preparing, and coordination of Directing Brain research and Clinical Brain research graduate understudies of the US who have practicum at DHHS and APA-licensed school brain science predoctoral entry level positions.\r\nYou have gotten this email since you have a proposal from the College Office to work with me.\r\n\r\nWould it be a good idea for you to acknowledge the proposition you'll briefly go about as my own colleague while we assist understudies with handicaps who are disappointed with obliviousness and the absence of administrations. To fulfill any interest you could have, I care about creature government assistance, expressions and culture, kids, social equality and social activity, schooling, climate, catastrophe and philanthropic alleviation, social administrations, and parts more.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely straightforward work. You will just assist me with mailing a few letters, make a couple of installments at Walmart, and buy a few things when required. This business just requires an hour daily, 2-3 days per week, for $900 week after week. I can't get together for a meeting since I'm currently away, helping handicapped understudies in Australia. By the way, you will be paid ahead of time for all undertakings done for my sake. A portion of my letters/mail will be sent to your home or close by the mailing station for you to get up whenever the timing is ideal. Upon my appearance, we will examine the chance of making this a drawn out work in the event that I am dazzled with your administrations while I'm away.\r\nI received your email through a waitlist from the HR Division to give out positions to a couple of understudies at your college. The college knows about everything.\r\nMercifully give the underneath Data to apply:\r\n\r\nNames:\r\nAddress:\r\nTelephone Number:\r\nAge:\r\nElective email unique in relation to school email:\r\n\r\nAnticipating hearing from you soon. Much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHeartily.\r\n\r\nDR Maya Ali",

I wanted to ask about the currency assignment. In your feedback, you noted that I didn't have returns for the other lags and didn't have a sensitivity analysis. In my excel, the returns are dependent on cells O3 and O4 which are the values of T and the , so when I adjust it, the returns, the sensitivity adjusted returns, the previous cell, and the Sharpe ratios adjust. I included the hard-coded table of the Sharpe ratios of the return based on the T value.  Would this not count as the sensitivity analysis and returns for other lags?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMelissa",

I was looking for some help and clarification on the paper. I'm writing about the history and impact of the One-Child Policy:\r\n\r\n1) If I write multiple sentences in a row using information from the same source, should each \r\nsentence have a separate footnote? How about if they are taken from the same or different page from the source?\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n2) I wanted to run my updated argument by you: \"The widespread social and economic repercussions of the One-Child Policy are unlikely to be addressed by the Three-Child Policy.\" Should I go further into reasons why in my thesis? I would mention the massive portion of the population leaving the workforce, the skill/sex composition of the workforce, urban/rural child-raising costs for economic impacts. For social impacts, I want to talk about the impacts of more men in society, such as more discontent and fertility rate decline. These impacts will last for decades, and incentives the Three-Child Policy won't boost fertility in the short-term as child-raising costs are still very high and many developed countries have low fertility rates. \r\n\r\n \r\n3) Is there a minimum word count? The footnotes look like they will take up a decent portion of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMelissa",

In light of this, tomorrow evening's class has been cancelled. I want you all to be able to partake in the festivities if you so please, plus I'm scared of traffic and don't want my car stuck in Dan Allen overnight. This week was going to be Monday screening / Wednesday lecture anyway, so please watch the entirety of Treasure Planet before Wednesday's class. It's such a magical film and well worth viewing as an adult. I will lecture on Wednesday, and then we'll have our final discussion of the semester. If you need anything in the meantime, I'm an email away.\r\n\r\nIn kindness,\r\n\r\nM",

As one of the most endangered canids in the world, only found in the wild in North Carolina, what could be a greater purpose on this Endangered Species Day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get inspired, watch my brief video below to learn about Red Wolves and why Endangered Species Day is so important.\r\n\r\nEndangered Species Day message from NCWF Red Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator\r\nWith 17 known Red Wolves in the wild, they are threatened daily by roads and vehicles running throughout their habitat as well as by gunshot. NCWF is committed to addressing these risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you drive on U.S. Highway 64 towards Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, you will likely see electronic signage telling you to slow down because you're in Red Wolf territory. NCWF helped pay for these signs and is advocating for more fencing and wildlife crossings to prevent Red Wolf and other wildlife vehicle collisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also see signs on private property that read \"Prey for the Pack\". NCWF works with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners on the Albemarle Peninsula to expand Red Wolf habitat by making habitat improvements that benefit Red Wolves, other wildlife, and the landowner through this cost-share program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI work every day to raise awareness about Red Wolves by operating the Red Wolf Center in Columbia, North Carolina. However, my favorite way to share the Red Wolf story is taking people out on the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges to experience Red Wolf habitat and all the wildlife that live there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome visit me at the Red Wolf Center and in the meantime, I invite you to donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May for Red Wolves, other listed wildlife, and those of greatest conservation need in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are lucky here in North Carolina, to be home to the world's only wild Red Wolves. Let's not let them go extinct on our watch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for caring and I hope to see you at the Red Wolf Center soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGratefully,\r\n\r\nKat\r\n\r\nDonate\r\n\t\r\nKaterina Ramos\r\n\r\nRed Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Wildlife Federation\r\n\r\n1221 NC-94\r\n\r\nColumbia, NC 27925\r\n\r\nPhone (252) 766-0320 \r\n\r\nWeb www.ncwf.org Email Katerina@ncwf.org\r\n\r\nP.S.

It was introduced in 1969 to commemorate the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 25th anniversary. It symbolizes NCWF's vision and strengths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Bison Legacy Act, passed by Congress in April 2016, made the bison a U.S. symbol of resilience, unity, and healthy landscapes and communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBison, unlike cattle, do not turn their backs to storms and bad weather, but face directly into the rain and winds. Like the bison, NCWF is agile, strong, dedicated to the cause, and faces a challenge full on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe one day the bison will be reintroduced in the wild in North Carolina too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther extinct species that once called North Carolina home, include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, and Bachman's warbler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough these species are some of the few to go fully extinct since colonization, they are not alone in facing threats of extinction, and they are certainly not the only ones to experience significant population declines at the hands of market hunting, habitat loss, and resource scarcity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTomorrow is Endangered Species Day and NCWF is raising awareness about endangered, threatened, and species of greatest conservation need in order to prevent further losses. You can make a difference right now by doing two things:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more about extinct wildlife in North Carolina\r\nDonate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May to support NCWF's work to protect, conserve, and restore listed species and those of greatest conservation need.\r\n\r\n\r\nLosing wildlife affects us all. Together, we can make a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\nDonate\r\n\t\r\nTim Gestwicki\r\n\r\nCEO\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Wildlife Federation\r\n\r\n1346 St. Julien Street\r\n\r\nCharlotte, NC 28205\r\n\r\nPhone (704) 332-5696 \r\n\r\nWeb www.ncwf.org Email Tim@ncwf.org\r\n\r\nP.S.

We are so excited for you to join us this summer! I wanted to begin walking you through the onboarding process. I just initiated a background check and drug screening via email. It is important to get this done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease see the details below regarding a background check and drug screening. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.\r\n\r\nYou should have received an email regarding the following:\r\n\r\nBackground Check\r\nDrug Screening\r\nYou will need to fill out the personal information required for Sterling to complete the background check. The entire process should be completed in no more than 5 days. The first 48 hours should be dedicated to ensuring the background check portion is completed by you. Please send me an email once you have completed the background check portion, as this will prompt us to launch out the drug screening portion of your clearance. This will permit you 72 hours to take the drug screening test. Once you enter your preferred address, this will automatically generate the closest drug screening locations to your home address. Please ensure the address you utilize is the address you physically reside in (even if just currently), so that you can get the nearest location. A chain of custody form will then be given to you to take to the laboratory, along with proper identification.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you notify us if the following occurs:\r\n\r\nYou cannot fill out the background check within the given 48 hours.\r\nYou cannot take the exam within the given 72 hours (either for personal reasons or unable to secure an appointment). Timely completion of the drug screening should be ensured, as we do expect a week or two turnaround time frames to have results provided back to us.\r\nIf you did not receive this email, please let me know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMadison Mackin\r\n\r\nHR Administrator\r\n\r\nSkanska USA Civil\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQueens, NY 11370, United States\r\n\r\nMobile\r\n\r\n+1 929 919 3444\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSkanska USA\r\n\r\nusa.skanska.com\r\n\r\nConnect With Us:\r\n\r\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | LinkedIn | Instagram | YouTube\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThink twice before you press \"print.\"\r\n\r\nThis message, including any attachments hereto, may contain privileged or confidential information and is sent solely for the attention and use of the intended addressee(s).

I wanted to see if there were any updates for the internship as I have not heard anything in some time and there does not seem to be any updates on USA-Jobs or USA Staffing. If it is just a matter of waiting I understand I was just curious about any updates.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJuan\r\n(252) 876-6385",

I am so proud of each of you for your hard work and great outcomes this year. Congratulations! Whether you just graduated or just finished your first year at NC State, you have earned a well-deserved break and I hope your summer plans include time for some rest and fun.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTurning the page on another academic year also gives us all the opportunity for reflection, growth and a look toward the future. My sincere hope is that amidst unexpected challenges and surprises of the last year, you also built new relationships, experienced the value of perseverance, and discovered new strengths you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you possessed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI also want to share my immense gratitude at the overwhelming kindness and enthusiasm with which you greeted me as your new dean of engineering! Every encounter with students in the College, from sharing pizza with our Engineering Ambassadors to helping graduate students find needed resources for their degree progress, has been an important part of my onboarding to our great University. It is the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your dean. My first year here greatly exceeded my expectations in large part due to your hospitality and welcome. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally, I want to share with you that our entire leadership team remains unwavering in our commitment to the support and success of all students who walk through our doors. Each of you brings unique perspective, experience and diversity to our teaching and learning. This enriches out work, makes us stronger, and provides a driving force to continually work to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo those of you who have graduated, know that while you are leaving the College, you remain a part of our COE community for a lifetime. And to those of you returning in the fall, please know that we are working overtime this summer to improve our student experience and strengthen all the programs that support you and ensure your wellbeing and achievement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wish you the very best, and as always do not hesitate to reach out to me at any time via email, LinkedIn, or Instagram.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\n\r\n\r\nDean Jim Pfaendtner",

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.\r\n\r\nThis amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.\r\n\r\nAs government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.\r\n\r\nWe hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.\r\n\r\nWe are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.\r\n\r\nNote that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr.George Emeka Emerah\r\nDirector, Finance Mini of Agriculture.\r\nEmail:mrgeorgeemerah2@gmail.com\r\nMy Cellphone:+ 234-911-815-7020\r\nWhattsapp:+ 234-911-815-7020",

He doesn't like us contacting his teachers and we encourage him to be as independent as possible with contacting teachers himself. However, it is still our responsibility to ensure that his anxiety and ADHD are under the best control possible and that he is utilizing all tools available to cope with both conditions. Therefore, I am contacting you to be sure there isn't something he is missing. Unfortunately, his anxiety holds him back from reaching out to teachers in situations where he knows he messed up something big.  \r\n \r\nWe all understand that the responsibility for this situation lies entirely on Hayden, and nothing in this email is intended to imply that any of it is on you. My goal is to figure out what Hayden did or didn't do to create this situation so I can provide him with as many tools as possible to avoid it in the future.\r\n \r\nThe problem is that Hayden had no idea there was going to be a History test yesterday (hence his poor grade). I asked how he was expected to know about the test. He said it was posted in the Google Classroom stream but he keeps forgetting to read that because almost all of the information is redundant. Instead he goes directly to his \"to do\" list in Google Classroom and accesses his assignments there. We had a long talk about the importance of reading the stream each day even if it seems like a waste of time to him since even one piece of critical information (like your test announcement), makes it worth reading daily.\r\n \r\nHis not reading the stream and going straight to the \"to do\" list is partly a function of his anxiety. He is very anxious to get his homework started each night and has a major anxiety spike if he has to do anything prior to starting on his work. This  plays a role in him skipping the feed and going straight to the \"to do\" list. Again - not making excuses for him, I just want you to understand in case you have any helpful ideas. I am hoping that this experience will make him feel the same urgency over missing information in the stream as he has over getting his homework completed. Additionally, we discussed how he could utilize his planner to help remember to check the stream.\r\n \r\nSo my question to you is whether there was any other way Hayden should have known about the test. Did he miss an announcement in class? Was it posted elsewhere that he should have seen? If the answer is simply that he needs to be better about checking the stream then I think we have done all we can on that for the time being.",

Last summer I had received an email that my GPA (which was at the time below a 3.0) was not high enough to stay in the honors program, and if I wanted to stay I needed to fill out a form. I did so and was allowed to stay in the program. As of right now my semester GPA is the highest it has ever been at a 3.7 (and last semester it was a 3.22) and has increased my cumulative GPA to a 3.17. This still is not within the program's requirements but as is evident by my semester GPA I have made huge strides to bring my GPA back up. I was curious that given my trajectory for maintaining a rising GPA (and ideally reaching a 3.25 by the end of fall '24 would be satisfactory to stay with the program or if I was still at risk of being removed. As it is very difficult to increase a GPA so drastically, I was hoping my obvious improvements would be enough.\r\n\r\nPlease keep me updated, \r\nBest Wishes,\r\nChloe Coursey",

Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the overall formal proposal.\r\n\r\nI am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online activity:\r\n\r\nBe sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Collaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about writing step-by-step instructions. The following \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have\u00e2\u0080\u009d list should help you get started on writing instructions if you have not already started:\r\n\r\nIntroduction and informative title \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she will be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as time required.\r\n\r\nStep-by-step list \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb followed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may occur if the action is done incorrectly\r\n\r\nFormat, fonts, and figures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users cues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for cautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps, or ones that require an important outcome.\r\n\r\nCautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of instructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user (e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be broken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning notices in the steps where they apply.\r\n\r\nConclusion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as information for additional information or support.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions, which have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions\r\n\r\nHave a great day.\r\n\r\nJamie",

The 2PM option works for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, I'd like to point out the following: \r\nI understand there is nothing that could really be done, and my exam was likely going to be rescheduled regardless. But I think it was highly inconsiderate how it was handled. I know the office received notice from my professor before 8 AM this morning that my exam was not to be taken today; because when I arrived prior to 8AM, I was informed that my professor did not want me taking it today. As a DISABILITY resource office, I would like to think the office would understand the potential harm to one of their registered students for not informing them ASAP. Even if the office did not know until the first person arrived this morning, an email would have been much better. To give you a sense this is where I stand now:\r\nI am a student with ADHD, I took my meds at 6AM so that they could be in effect by 8AM. This means, they will no longer be working around 6-7 PM this evening. I have an exam today at 3:30, so my priority from getting home this morning to 3:30 will be studying for that exam. When I get home around 4:30 or 5, I will have approximately an hour of study time (as my meds will not be working past 6). I have two exams the next day at 8AM and 2PM, so my focus will be my 8AM exam, leaving me with no prep for my 2PM exam. Then, I get home another day at 5:45, after a day of taking my meds at 6AM and will barely be able to study for my NOW Wednesday exam at 2PM. So now, I have almost 2 days to lose all knowledge for my exam. Of course this is a bit of an exaggeration, and since I have lived with ADHD for almost 21 years, I have mechanisms to try and study after my meds are worn off, but I still am not as productive. \r\n\r\nI know there was not much you could do, but I want to bring attention to how highly inconsiderate it was to not inform me immediately after knowing the situation. And how ESPECIALLY inconsiderate it was to send me my location notice at 5:19 PM if you guys had already known (which I suspect/hope you did not). I do appreciate your time and effort to reschedule my exam. I just wanted to let you know so that maybe if this happens to another/with another student in the future it can be prevented.",

I was reading the emails again and I understand that there is a guest speaker until about 11:30 but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m unclear if orientation ends after that or if it continues until 5.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nChloe Coursey",

I am hoping to compile messages for him, from the alum and even current students, so the alumni office helped me gather some emails.  I am obviously very proud of all that he has built at Good Counsel, and he is so proud of you and all that you have gone on to accomplish.  He would love to hear from you about any memories or feelings you have about the program and your time with him!  IF you would be willing to send him a message - feel free to write me a note, that I will compile into some kind of memory book.  I am also hoping that you can help spread the word - feel free to forward this message to any students you know from the STEM classes who might want to send a message and if you have any pictures I would love those as well!  \r\nThanks,\r\n Karen",

College has been going smoothly for me so far!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am so sorry to ask on such short notice but I lost track of time and realized I need a recommendation letter for a scholarship application that is due on the 11th. I am REALLY sorry for the short notice but I am really hoping you could write it for me?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf not, I totally understand as it is so last minute. The scholarship is through Shady Grove fertility and as someone carried by a surrogate, I am eligible for the scholarship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe recommendation letter requirements/outline are:\r\n\r\nPlease upload one letter of recommendation. The letter must be written by a teacher, coach, or guidance counselor that can speak to your character.\r\n\r\nFor those with confidential letters of recommendation, please have your teacher, counselor, etc email the letter to ali.williams@sgfertility.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain, I am so sorry for the extremely short notice and hope you have been doing well this past school year! I miss talking with you and hope to visit either on my Spring break or before GC lets out for the summer!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChloe Coursey",

I have attached a document that you can complete and return to disability@ncsu.edu that will add your mom to the list of people on your FERPA so we may discuss your eligibility status with her. When you completed the intake on May 7, you only listed Melvin Coursey beside Parent Name(s).\r\n2. On May 19th, the DRO emailed you your Eligibility Summary and listed the required next steps for you to receive accommodations at NCSU. Please review your email for this important information. As stated in that email, I am available to meet if you have additional questions.\r\n3. The DRO does not manage course waitlists, I suggest you keep checking to see if a space opens up in the section you are hoping to enroll in or perhaps try to rearrange a few other courses if taking Calculus I is a priority. It may also be helpful to connect with your Academic Advisor to discuss other possible options.\r\n4. If you would like to change your preferred email at NCSU, click here for instructions. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have additional questions,\r\nLeslie",

Tell me if you have any changes or just flat out don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it. Basically we will be comparing David and Goliath to  the Apostles. If you are already confused, just read the attachment below, hopefully it will explain what I mean better than I can right now. Also, I have a concussion and am still trying to figure out if I can participate in the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Message. I think I will be able to, but just in case you should figure out if you want to do something else if I am not there. Also, I totally do not care if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do this. Please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel obliged to say yes (or no). Finally, feel free to respond to me over text \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChloe",

It has truly been a pleasure!\r\n\r\nRegardless of graduation status, I would very much appreciate you all taking a few minutes to complete a survey regarding your experience with Upper-Level Events this previous semester. Responses from these forms will help build the case for continuing these events and setting aside an appropriate budget for them. They also (of course) help us understand what can be done better, what you absolutely loved, and what we need more of. Your feedback here is greatly valued.\r\n\r\nIf you attended any standard Upper-Level Events, please fill out this survey.\r\n\r\nIf you attended any of the Upper-Level Trips (Ski Trip, Richmond, or Nashville), please fill out this survey.\r\n\r\nThank you all so much for your time! I hope to see you soon :)",

As you hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty wowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in person, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical to bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through the chat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure you register ahead of time for the session you plan to attend.\r\n\r\nZoom registration link for Monday, August 16 at 3:00 PM\r\n\r\nZoom registration link for Tuesday, August 17 at 3:00 PM\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso, here is a link to the USP 110 syllabus for your review, in case you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nChester Brewer (he/him/his)\r\nAssistant Director, University Scholars Program\r\nDivision of Academic and Student Affairs\r\nP: 919.513.0704\r\nuhsp.dasa.ncsu.edu\r\n\r\nNC State University\r\n206 Clark Hall\r\nCampus Box 7316\r\nRaleigh, NC 27695",

Keep on reading if you are interested in any of those! \r\n\r\nMs. Kurtz\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT:\r\n\r\nThis Fall, Engineering Ambassadors are organizing study groups for students in CH 101, MA 141/241/242, and PY 205/208. This will be an excellent opportunity for you to work on homework, go over lecture notes, study for tests, and meet other STEM students. You do not have to be in engineering in order to participate! If you're interested in participating please complete the Google form below by Friday (8/27).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy join a study group? Studies have shown that students absorb material a lot better through collaboration. As a part of a study group, you will:\r\n\r\nFill in any gaps in your understanding\r\n\r\nGain a new perspective on the material\r\n\r\nStrengthen your understanding by teaching others\r\n\r\nReduce your potential to procrastinate\r\n\r\nBreak the monotony of studying alone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo join a study group, you must attend a virtual Study Group Meet-Up for the subject(s) of your choice led by the Engineering Ambassador team. You are only required to go to one session in order to participate in a group for that subject. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the first week of meet-ups, we will have 2 sessions per respective date. The Meet-Ups will be held as follows, all via Zoom: \r\n\r\nCalculus (MA 141, 241, and 242): \r\n\r\nMonday, 8/30: 6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM\r\n\r\nPhysics (PY 205 and PY 208): \r\n\r\nTuesday, 8/31:  6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM\r\n\r\nChemistry (CH 101): \r\n\r\nWednesday 9/01: 6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the second week of meet-ups, we will have 1 session per day.. The Meet-Ups will be held as follows, all via Zoom: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhysics (PY 205 and PY 208): \r\n\r\nTuesday, 9/07, 6:00-6:45 PM\r\n\r\nChemistry (CH 101): \r\n\r\nWednesday 9/08, 6:00 - 6:45 PM\r\n\r\nCalculus (MA 141, 241, and 242): \r\n\r\nThursday, 9/09, 6:00 - 6:45 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these Meet-ups, we will be creating the groups and going through some of the campus resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease RSVP using the following links. You may RSVP for multiple subjects, but you must fill out the form in order to receive the Zoom link.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLink to RSVP for Chemistry\r\n\r\nLink to RSVP for Calculus\r\n\r\nLink to RSVP for Physics\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe forms will close on Friday, August 27.

This step is required for you to continue working at Wellness and Recreation and attend trainings on Sunday for Official and/or Scorekeeper.\r\n\r\nPlease email me back once you completed Section 1! \r\n\r\nAs long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training. You then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person.\r\n\r\nThe following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen Tucci.\r\n\r\nCompleting I-9 Sections 1 & 2\r\nAfter selecting an orientation date, you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right away) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour NC State University Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created\u00e2\u0080\u009d) providing you with information on completing Section 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at home. It is your responsibility to complete Section 1 on time. If you do not complete Section 1, you will not be able to complete Section 2 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNote: Your Social Security number (SSN) will be required to complete Section 1. If you do not have one, you need to apply for one. If you DO need to apply for a Social Security number, you must check the Awaiting Issuance of SSN box in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cU.S. Social Security No\u00e2\u0080\u009d. field in Section 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you have completed Section 1, Section 2 must be completed within three business days after Wellness and Recreation New Student Employee Orientation. An authorized representative of NC State University must complete Section 2 with your original I-9 Acceptable Documents in-person, so you will need to make arrangements to visit the I-9 Center. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReview the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of I-9 Acceptable Documents.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBring original documents (no copies) from this list; be sure to bring in one selection from List A, OR a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C.\r\n\r\nSection 2 Completion The I-9 Center, located in room 101 of the Administrative Services II (2711 Sullivan Drive), is open Monday \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Friday from 9:00 am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4:00 pm. Walk-in appointments are available. If you have questions, please email i9questions@ncsu.edu.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe I-9 Center has made many modifications to their building and their service to best ensure the safety of customers and their staff.  For your safety and the safety of others, the following are required of all individuals visiting the I-9 Hub:\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00b7   \tYou must wear a face mask during the appointment, \r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00b7   \tYou must maintain a distance of least 6 feet from others, and\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00b7   \tYou must enter and exit only through the specifically marked doors.\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00b7   \tPlease review the following information about safety on the Protect the Pack website and in the How to Return to Campus Safely Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant information for F-1/J-1 international student employees: \r\n\r\nUnder U.S. employment law, an employee's attendance of an employer's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings is considered employment hours and must be paid. As such, time spent in Wellness and Recreation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orientation, onboarding, and trainings (including those completed remotely by the employee such as an online training done at home) will be recorded and paid by NCSU in the week(s) in which they occur. As a reminder, F-1/J-1 international students are limited to 20/hours per week of on-campus employment when school is in session. Therefore, if you have other on-campus employment, you may need to reduce your hours at that job to ensure you do not exceed 20 hours/week total of on-campus employment when you attend Wellness and Recreation's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings. If you have a 0.5 FTE graduate assistantship or are not able to reduce your current on-campus employment hours, you may need to attend the new employer's required events once Summer or Winter break has begun or during a week when there is a break in classes such as Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break, Spring Break, or Spring Holiday. If you have questions about this, please speak with an OIS advisor before attending these events.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor questions related to Form I-9, E-Verify, and New Student Employee Orientation please contact Stephen Tucci at sltucci@ncsu.edu; for questions about your new position, please contact your direct supervisor. \r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBen Strunk\r\nAssistant Director, Sports Programs\r\nWellness and Recreation\r\nNC State University\r\nDivision of Academic and Student Affairs\r\nP: 919.515.1862\r\nwellrec.ncsu.edu",

Our 1:45pm problem session was, let's say, sparsely attended. I posted notes from the one question from 2.3 that was asked (#5) and then a trig substitution question and another example that someone asked about today. You can find all of this under the HW Hints section of our moodle page.\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some questions from 2.5 and 2.6, but I do understand that partial fractions can be tricky and that assignment is due tonight. \r\n\r\nHope you are all doing well. It was great to see the people who came to the sessions. Be sure to take the poll about when an optional recorded review session will be if you are interested in attending. It looks like it is mostly between Friday at 5pm and Sunday at 5pm. \r\n\r\nMs. Kurtz\r\n\r\n--\r\nLeslie Kurtz\r\nSenior Lecturer\r\nTransfer Officer\r\nDirector of Summer School\r\nNorth Carolina State University \r\nDepartment of Mathematics\r\nOffice: SAS 3240\r\nEmail: lakurtz@ncsu.edu\r\nPhone: 919.513.2111\r\nWebpage: https://kurtz.wordpress.ncsu.edu",

We have contacted our phone company, and they will be out tomorrow, Saturday, May 25, 2024.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can not open the pool today, as the phone pool is not working. We are hopeful that after the visit from the phone company tomorrow, we will be able to open the pool. Please watch for email updates throughout the weekend.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while our office phones are experiencing issues. If you need to reach us, our email is working. Our email address is maa900waterford@maac.com.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your understanding and please check your email for updates.\r\n\r\nMAA 900 Waterford\r\n",

If you have finished it correctly, just ignore this email.  The comments I keep sharing:\r\n\r\nMake it public.  I can't see it until you do.\r\n\r\nUpload the link to the actual LiveBinder from your account.  I need to see your LiveBinder project, not just all the documents and assignments from this course.\r\n\r\nTake all first person references out of your research.  There are no \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc. in professional research.  You use phrases such as \"the authors share.....\", or \"according to (author) in (article) ........, or \" research show that....\"\r\n\r\nRemove all class headings from all assignments.  This should not read like a compilation of class work.  In fact, your name is only on your LiveBinder.\r\n\r\nYou will not need an outline AND a table of contents.  They are the same, so pick one.\r\n\r\nAvoid links inside LiveBinder.  Use as few as possible.  Each new tab should not be another link to open.  Think about your Week 8 presentation and how smoothly you will want to move from one document to the next.\r\n\r\nMake sure all pictures and videos are right side up.  Some are posting sideways.\r\n\r\nI've only had 2 (out of 20) that I graded.  All others needs at least some tweaking.  So let's just say you edit this weekend and I begin to grade Monday.  Review yours for all the notes above and resubmit when you've had a chance to clean it up.  Message or email me if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\nKaitlyn has agreed to provide assistance if needed.  You can email her at kaiburdette@augusta.edu.  If others who seem to know how to navigate LiveBinder also agree to support, I'll share their names with you so we don't kill Kaitlyn!!",

Please use this time to take a breather or catch up on work if needed. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also wanted to let all students know that during spring break (because of the Masters), the University pretty much shuts down, and the majority of offices are closed. \r\n\r\nI want to let everyone know that I will not be available next week, but there will be rotating success staff that will be responding to emails at the AUO Success email. However, please know that because most offices on campus will be closed, any issues or adjustments concerning registration must occur after spring break. \r\n\r\nDuring this pause, please remember to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take a walk, watch a movie, eat some good food, and get some rest. You all work so hard and you have earned that break! \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGina Bolin\r\nDirector of Online Student Support Services\r\nAugusta University Online\r\nEmail: gbolin@augusta.edu\r\nPhone: 706.729.2125 \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tBook time to meet with me\t",

Is it just a difference of format (checkboxes vs structured outline), or is there a content difference (and if so, what is that difference)?\r\nIf you are able, would you please take a look at my outline to see if it has what you are looking for? I haven't written the paragraph to go with it yet, but please let me know if the structure matches what you are looking for, and if I have generally covered the information you are looking for in the outline. Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cr3qdJlmpcS1eosCXfm6Er6aSqAKlV9_SLGmm22Psic/edit?usp=sharing\r\nWould you please look at my LiveBinder to make sure it is all working correctly, and that you are able to view it? The access key is \"intervention\" (no quotation marks or caps). Here is the link: https://www.livebinders.com/b/3582727\r\nAlso related to the LiveBinder: I have split up the content of the assignments into different tabs for organization. Is that ok, or do the assignments need to be uploaded in the same documents they were submitted in via D2L?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nErin Coursey",

I have viewed many intro videos and already love this group!  Thanks for sharing your background, interests, and for some of you- your humor!  I've also begun looking at your discussion posts.  Wow!  Thanks for making your connections so personal and true.  I will usually end my reply with a question or two.  You do not need to answer those questions- those are to prompt further thinking.\r\n\r\nI believe this class began Monday, March 4.  That makes today day 3 of this class.  If you have not yet uploaded your intro video or started your discussion post, make that a priority tomorrow.  Remember to reply to classmates, too.  My intent is to grade your discussion post once you have replied to 3 classmates.  I will use the discussion rubric posted in the Module 1 for grading.\r\n\r\nLastly for tonight, I'm trying to reply to questions as they come in.  That means sometimes I reply from my watch or phone.  I'm not very good at either!  I just want to get you an answer quickly.  My watch and phone replies are short and to the point.  I do not text quickly, so I skip the niceties.  Please know that if I reply \"sure\" or \"okay\" or \"not yet\" that I also mean \"I hope you are having a wonderful day.  If there is anything else you need, just let me know.\"  and all that jazz.  As you can tell, I'm much wordier on emails than on texts.\r\n\r\nPLEASE let me know what I can do to make this course better and more meaningful for you!  We are in these next 8 weeks together and will all come out the other side better.\r\n\r\nCheri Ogden",

I have just received confirmation that Duke has updated your meter and sent us permission to operate it. The last step is to energize your system.\r\n\r\n1. Flip the lever on the AC disconnect to the ON position.\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2024-04-09 142024.png\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Verify the breakers in the Enphase combiner box are in the ON position.\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2024-04-09 142112.png\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Verify that the 40 amp breaker inside the meter combination panel is in the ON position.\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2024-04-09 142144.png\r\nOnce these steps are completed, the system will be on and producing. We have also sent you access to Enphase's online portal. You should see an email in your inbox. If it is not in your inbox, please check the spam folder. Please complete your registration, and that will allow you to monitor your system on Enphase's online portal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a valued customer, I'd love to request an internet review from you for 8MSolar. Your feedback is crucial in helping others make informed decisions about their solar needs. As a token of appreciation, we'll send a $30 gift card for a 5-star review. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

We certainly understand that oversights happen with all the other day to day priorities placed on us as individuals. As a valued member of the Nanticoke Indian Association, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNIA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we are providing you this gentle reminder.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThrough the Nanticoke Indian Association and its members and despite the coronavirus pandemic, we are continuing our work to improve our Tribal awareness, our Tribal community, education opportunities, job training, and employment opportunities along with providing other valuable resources that work to improve the quality of life for our members and the tribe.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Nanticoke Indian Association Dues assist us in many ways including funding family-oriented activities, cultural sharing, and community events that will resume as soon as it is safe for our members, volunteers, and staff.  These events raise money to support our association, historic museum, student scholarships, and our neighboring tribal community. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAccording to the following By-Laws adopted on June 7, 2005 and revised on August 5, 2014:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnnual Dues shall be assessed to each Regular and Associate Member in the amount of TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), due on January 1st of each year. \r\nAny member unable to pay his/her dues by January 15th of the current year shall receive a written notice that his/her Membership dues are past due.  \r\nIf dues are not paid by February 28th of the current year, the Member will be removed from the membership rolls.\r\nShould you be dropped from the membership rolls because of non-payment of dues, reinstatement requires that you complete and submit all paperwork, genealogies, fees, etc. \r\nCurrent Reinstatement fee is $60.00 - this includes fees and dues.\r\nIf the applicant is below the age of 18 years, the reinstatement fee is $35.00 (fees and dues). \r\n \r\n\r\nWe certainly would not want to lose you as a valued member due to a mere oversight on your behalf.  We would like you to know we truly appreciate you as a member and welcome your continued support in the upcoming year.  Also, please know that you can renew for multiple years if this is more convenient for you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you feel you have received this notice in error, please contact the NIA office immediately, so we can update our records. We apologize in advance for any errors and as always welcome your feedback!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns regarding membership, please contact the office which is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. or email info@nanticokeindians.org.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                               \r\n\r\nAvery S.
