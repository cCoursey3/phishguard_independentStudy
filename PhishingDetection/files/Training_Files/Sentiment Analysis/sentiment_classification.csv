"Subject: distributions         Hi Steve,         Thanks for your help on this. Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:         May 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and 2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up         August 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and 2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.         So our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which for me should have been around  $112,625.         Thanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend.

"Subject: Re: Hayden testing arrangements        Hi Robin,     I'm so sorry - the whole reason we've been trying to get him in sooner was so that if he needs medication we could try it over Christmas break rather than while he is in school. If we have to wait until after break for the follow up it would be better to just stick with the original s of Dec 20 and 21. Are those still free? If not, do you have an earlier follow up slot? That way Hayden could possibly do his follow up over xmas break and not miss school for that.     If Dec 20 and 21 are no longer available could you just give me a call? That will probably be easiest given how complicated this is.     Thanks  Megan ",Neutral/Benign

Then we'll check into The Historic Powhatan, a residences resort with amenities including: indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, tennis and racquetball courts, and a mini-golf course.    Saturday will be devoted to Water Country USA, Virginia's largest water park -- wave pools, lazy rivers, water coasters, live entertainment, and more!

These are opportunities for students to engage in experiential learning outside the classroom in a way that directly aligns with their individual goals. This requirement also gives students the opportunity to reflect on how these experiences impact their learning in preparation for life after college such as graduate school or employment applications.    This email is meant to serve as a gentle reminder that if you completed what would qualify as a High Impact Experience at any point during this academic school year, it is preferred you submit your reflection essay for that HIE before we get very far into the summer months. DO NOT stress over writing these reflections before your final exams are over, but please do submit them sometime soon after! Ideally, going forward, we would like students to submit their reflections within the same semester that their HIE concluded (within 4-6 weeks) so that the experience is still fresh in their minds and they have plenty of details to share in their reflection essay.    DISCIPLINARY BREADTH EXCEPTION: the exception to the above “deadline guideline” of “within 4-6 weeks of the experience concluding” is our “Disciplinary Breadth” category. If a student is double majoring or majoring and minoring in academic programs from two different academic colleges, we would rather you wait until the semester of your graduation to reflect on what studying under those differing academic programs has done for you as a person and future professional.     An explanation of the High Impact Experience requirement has always been linked on our website, but we have also recently recorded a short (4:19) video, linked below with a transcript, to better explain the HIE requirement and the various HIE categories under which students can submit their HIE reflections.    Since this video was recorded, an additional slide has been added to the HIEs Explained slide deck with some examples of professional and/or personally developmental opportunities available to students from around the University that would definitely qualify as a High Impact Experience upon successful completion.    HONORS CAPSTONE PROJECT : Remember that students who submit their undergraduate research as an Honors Capstone Project can earn two out of their three required High Impact Experiences at once!    If you have any questions or concerns about the High Impact Experience requirement for the Honors Program, please reach out to your Honors Program advisor.

"subject:	IMPORTANT ECE 403 001 Exam Tomorrow    Good Afternoon,    You do not know me because I am not in one of your classes but I’m reaching out to you on behalf of one of your current students Owen Gabriel Gromyko.    I’m honestly not sure if he is in your class but i know he is in ECE 401 001 and is expecting to take an exam tomorrow at 8:30. If he is not one of your students, I apologize and hope you can redirect me accordingly.    I’m sure this is unusual, but I want to ask if it would even be possible for him to take his exam at least later in the day. He is sick with what I believe is the flu. I’ve been tending to him for a bit and he is having HORRIBLE muscle fatigue, sweats, pains, etc. All classic signs of the flu. I came over after he took an exam this morning and he told me how bad he was doing and that he had no pain meds for his headache. As his partner I came to help him. I’ve been on his bedside changing a cool cloth every few minutes because his temperature keeps causing it to heat up so quickly. Unfortunately he doesn’t have a thermometer where he lives so I can’t even send formal proof of his state.     I told him to try and reach out earlier but he assured me there was no way his exam could be considered for a later time. However, considering the increased emphasis on student health physically and mentally, I was hoping you would consider, if nothing else, allowing him to take the exam at a different hour. As I’m sure you can conclude, being this sick and worrying about an 8:30 am exam is not ideal for the healing process.    I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause or disrespect this may come across as on my part, but I want what is best for him and I’m confident an exam tomorrow is not that, much less at 8:30 in the morning.    I did not copy him on this email because I did not want his hopes to get up; plus I know him and he’d probably try to tough it out instead of risking offending a professor. I hope you will consider what I am suggesting.    Best,  Chloe Coursey",Neutral/Benign

"  Subject: BME 375 Final Exam - Cindy Nguyen  Hi Bob,    Please see below for my answers to the final exam questions. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your guidance and support throughout the course. Your insights have been invaluable to my learning experience. Thank you once again.    *************************************    Microcontrollers I - Spring 2024    FINAL EXAMINATION      Q1: Describe in 1 or 2 sentences what each of these Arduino functions or operators do:        random(min, max): Generates pseudo-random numbers. It returns a random number between min and max-1.            delay(): Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as a parameter. It is useful for creating   longer delays where timing precision is not critical.            delayMicroseconds(): This function pauses the program for the specified number of microseconds. It is useful for creating   very short delays, especially when working with timing-sensitive components (i.e. sensors or communication protocols).            micros(): Returns the number of microseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program.            millis():  Returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program            analogWrite(): generates a PWM signal on a specified pin, allowing control over the output voltage level, which is   useful for controlling the brightness of an LED, the speed of a motor, or the position of a servo.            !=  (example: x != y): stands for ""not equal to"" and is used to compare two values. The expression x != y evaluates   to ‘true’ if x is not equal to y, and ‘false’ otherwise.            %:  Calculates the remainder when one integer is divided by another.            &&: It is the logical AND operator used to combine two conditions. It returns true if both conditions it connects   are true, and false            ==: Compares the left variable with the right value or variable in the operator, returning ‘true’ if they are equal.            =:   It is the assignment operator used to assign a value to a variable            EEPROM.put():  Writes values to the EEPROM using variable semantics.            EEPROM.get():  Retrieves values from EEPROM so that we can print them as floats on the serial monitor using Serial.print()  or Serial.println()         Q2: For the millis() function, how long will the counter run before it overflows (reaches its maximum then starts counting again from zero)?        The counter is an ‘unsigned long’ type, which means it can hold values from  0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1). This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately  50 days.        Q3: For the micros() function, how long will the counter run before it overflows (reaches its maximum then starts counting again from zero)?        The counter is an ‘unsigned long’ type, which means it can hold values from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1). This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately  71.6 minutes.        Q4: For the analogWrite() function, using your Arduino Uno, what are the PWM frequencies that you would get on the analog output pins?        The Arduino Uno's analogWrite() function uses PWM on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. The PWM frequency on most pins is around  490 Hz, while pins 5 and 6 have a frequency of around  980 Hz.         Q5: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type ""int"":     - How many bytes are stored in an ""int""?        There are 2 bytes in an “int”.       - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in an int?        The minimum value that can be stored is -32,768,   and the maximum value is 32,767 in an int.        Q6: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type ""float"":     - How many bytes are stored in a ""float""?         There are 4 bytes in a “float”.       - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in a float?        “float” data type can represent a wide range of values. The minimum value that can be stored in a float is -3.4028235E+38 and   the maximum value is 3.4028235E+38.        Q7: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type ""unsigned int"":     - How many bytes are stored in an ""unsigned int""?        There are 2 bytes in an “unsigned int”.       - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in an unsigned int?        The minimum value that can be stored in an unsigned int is  0, and the maximum value is  65,535.        Q8: On the Arduino Uno, several data types are available.  For the data type ""long"":     - How many bytes are stored in a ""long""?        There are 4 bytes in “long”.       - What are the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in a long?        The minimum value that can be stored in a long is  -2,147,483,648, and the maximum value is  2,147,483,647.        Q9: Many Arduino circuits are built using a solderless breadboard. These can cause problems. Describe at least one major problem that can be caused by using a solderless breadboard?        Solderless breadboards can cause problems with complex circuits because of the large amount of wiring required. A major issue with solderless breadboards is their less secure connections compared to   soldered ones, which can lead to unreliable circuit behavior especially with high-frequency or high-current circuits.        Q10:    What is an ""internal pullup""?        An ""internal pullup"" is a resistor that can be internally connected to a digital input pin in an Arduino. It pulls the pin's voltage to HIGH (5V) when the pin is not actively driven LOW (0V), helping   maintain a defined voltage level on the pin in the absence of an external circuit. This prevents floating inputs and reduces electrical noise.        How do you use it (how do you activate it)?        To activate the internal pullup resistor, you use the  pinMode()  function with the mode INPUT_PULLUP. For example,  pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP);        What command is used by Arduino to activate an internal pullup?        pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP);        What does it do?        The INPUT_PULLUP mode in Arduino sets a digital pin to the HIGH level by connecting an internal resistor between the digital pin and the power supply (VCC). This pull-up resistor typically has a value   of around 20-50 kΩ and helps prevent floating inputs, which can lead to high current consumption.        Why would you use it?        An internal pullup is used to simplify circuit design by removing the necessity for an external resistor to pull a digital input pin to the HIGH level. This is particularly useful when connecting switches   or buttons that are normally open, as the internal pullup resistor ensures a stable HIGH state when the switch or button is not pressed.        Q11: To find answers to questions you may have in the future, for further learning, or to see new project Ideas, list at least three resources that are freely available to you:        Arduino Forum: The forum is helpful for seeking answers to Arduino-related questions and discovering fresh project   ideas.          ChatGPT:  It's a useful tool for debugging code and getting answers to various questions, although its accuracy may vary.          Classmates:  Other students in the class could offer insights and solutions to common problems, making them a great resource for addressing questions.          Youtube: It’s a rich source of tutorials and project demonstrations for Arduino enthusiasts.        Q12: Think of a medical or health-related device that you could build using a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Describe the device, what it is useful for, and how it would work, with a brief discussion of the features you would use to make the device function.        A medical device that I could build using a microcontroller such as an Arduino is the  Finger Pulse Oximeter.  It is used to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. The device uses LEDs to emit light through a finger, which is then measured by a photodetector to determine the SpO2 and calculate   the heart rate. The microcontroller controls the LEDs, reads the photodetector signal, processes the data to calculate SpO2 and heart rate, and displays the results on a screen.            Features:          LEDs: Emit light at specific wavelengths (usually red) to penetrate the skin and blood.          Photodetector: Detect the light transmitted through the finger and convert it into an electrical signal.          Signal Processing: Algorithms to process the photodetector signal and calculate SpO2 and heart rate.              Sent: Tuesday, April 23, 2024 2:48 AM  To: bob bobslab.com <bob@bobslab.com>  Cc: bob@unc.edu <bob@unc.edu>;   Subject: BME 375 Final Exam - Cindy Nguyen   Display: Show the measured SpO2 and heart rate values.          User Interface: Buttons or a touchscreen to control the device and navigate menus.          Power Supply: Battery or external power source to power the device.        Note: Alternatively, an oximeter sensor such as the MAX30101 by SparkFun can be used in replacement of the LEDs and the photodetector. The MAX30101 performs sensing by using its internal LEDs to bounce light off the arteries and arterioles in the finger's subcutaneous layer, while its photodetectors sense how much light is absorbed.     *************************************    Sincerely,  Cindy N.",Neutral/Benign

During this period, I’ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but оnе is of special significance to me.     I’ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial роrn videos. Given that the “questionable” genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick реrvеrsiоn.     I doubt you’d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.     Every number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vidеоs – on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email – everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your fоrmеr life.     Don’t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your реrvеrsiоn might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved рunishmеnt to stop you.     I’m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don’t panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my mеrсy is not free.     Transfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0     Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will реrmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstаll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure – my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.     I’ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don’t worry, it’s very simple. Just google “crypto exchange” or ""buy Litecoin"" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.     I strongly warn you against the following:  * Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.  * Do not contact the police. I have access to all your dеviсеs, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.  * Don’t try to reset or destroy your dеviсеs. As I mentioned above: I’m monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vidеоs are рublished.     Also, don’t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it’s impossible to identify me using the provided аddrеss.     Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.  And some friendly advice: from now on, don’t be so careless about your online security.",Urgent/Threatening

I give individual and gathering treatment as well as training, evaluation, and scholastic screenings to help understudies with physical and mental handicaps, among others enrolled with the DHHS.  An enormous level of the understudies served by this psychological well-being unit have mental or co-horrible mental inabilities and need emotional wellness backing to find lasting success at the college. Accordingly, the unit gives the expected emotional well-being support while seeing and surveying undiscovered college understudies with scholastic hardships through the scholarly screening and evaluation process.

This is extremely straightforward work. You will just assist me with mailing a few letters, make a couple of installments at Walmart, and buy a few things when required. This business just requires an hour daily, 2-3 days per week, for $900 week after week. I can't get together for a meeting since I'm currently away, helping handicapped understudies in Australia. By the way, you will be paid ahead of time for all undertakings done for my sake. A portion of my letters/mail will be sent to your home or close by the mailing station for you to get up whenever the timing is ideal. Upon my appearance, we will examine the chance of making this a drawn out work in the event that I am dazzled with your administrations while I'm away.

Should I go further into reasons why in my thesis? I would mention the massive portion of the population leaving the workforce, the skill/sex composition of the workforce, urban/rural child-raising costs for economic impacts. For social impacts, I want to talk about the impacts of more men in society, such as more discontent and fertility rate decline. These impacts will last for decades, and incentives the Three-Child Policy won't boost fertility in the short-term as child-raising costs are still very high and many developed countries have low fertility rates.        3) Is there a minimum word count?

As one of the most endangered canids in the world, only found in the wild in North Carolina, what could be a greater purpose on this Endangered Species Day?        To get inspired, watch my brief video below to learn about Red Wolves and why Endangered Species Day is so important.    Endangered Species Day message from NCWF Red Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator  With 17 known Red Wolves in the wild, they are threatened daily by roads and vehicles running throughout their habitat as well as by gunshot. NCWF is committed to addressing these risks.        When you drive on U.S. Highway 64 towards Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, you will likely see electronic signage telling you to slow down because you're in Red Wolf territory. NCWF helped pay for these signs and is advocating for more fencing and wildlife crossings to prevent Red Wolf and other wildlife vehicle collisions.        You may also see signs on private property that read ""Prey for the Pack"". NCWF works with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners on the Albemarle Peninsula to expand Red Wolf habitat by making habitat improvements that benefit Red Wolves, other wildlife, and the landowner through this cost-share program.        I work every day to raise awareness about Red Wolves by operating the Red Wolf Center in Columbia, North Carolina. However, my favorite way to share the Red Wolf story is taking people out on the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges to experience Red Wolf habitat and all the wildlife that live there.        Come visit me at the Red Wolf Center and in the meantime, I invite you to donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May for Red Wolves, other listed wildlife, and those of greatest conservation need in North Carolina.        We are lucky here in North Carolina, to be home to the world's only wild Red Wolves. Let's not let them go extinct on our watch!        Thank you for caring and I hope to see you at the Red Wolf Center soon!

"Tim Gestwicki, CEO, NCWF <tim@ncwf.org>  : Thu, May 16, 2024 at 8:31 AM  Subject: Remembering Extinct Wildlife in NC  To: <tlbelus@ncsu.edu>  Trisha,        I often get questions about the prominent bison in NCWF's logo. It was introduced in 1969 to commemorate the organization’s 25th anniversary. It symbolizes NCWF's vision and strengths.        The National Bison Legacy Act, passed by Congress in April 2016, made the bison a U.S. symbol of resilience, unity, and healthy landscapes and communities.        Bison, unlike cattle, do not turn their backs to storms and bad weather, but face directly into the rain and winds. Like the bison, NCWF is agile, strong, dedicated to the cause, and faces a challenge full on.        Maybe one day the bison will be reintroduced in the wild in North Carolina too.        Other extinct species that once called North Carolina home, include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, and Bachman's warbler.        Though these species are some of the few to go fully extinct since colonization, they are not alone in facing threats of extinction, and they are certainly not the only ones to experience significant population declines at the hands of market hunting, habitat loss, and resource scarcity.        Tomorrow is Endangered Species Day and NCWF is raising awareness about endangered, threatened, and species of greatest conservation need in order to prevent further losses. You can make a difference right now by doing two things:        Read more about extinct wildlife in North Carolina  Donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May to support NCWF's work to protect, conserve, and restore listed species and those of greatest conservation need.      Losing wildlife affects us all. Together, we can make a difference.

I am so proud of each of you for your hard work and great outcomes this year. Congratulations! Whether you just graduated or just finished your first year at NC State, you have earned a well-deserved break and I hope your summer plans include time for some rest and fun.         Turning the page on another academic year also gives us all the opportunity for reflection, growth and a look toward the future. My sincere hope is that amidst unexpected challenges and surprises of the last year, you also built new relationships, experienced the value of perseverance, and discovered new strengths you didn’t know you possessed.         I also want to share my immense gratitude at the overwhelming kindness and enthusiasm with which you greeted me as your new dean of engineering! Every encounter with students in the College, from sharing pizza with our Engineering Ambassadors to helping graduate students find needed resources for their degree progress, has been an important part of my onboarding to our great University. It is the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your dean. My first year here greatly exceeded my expectations in large part due to your hospitality and welcome. Thank you so much.         Finally, I want to share with you that our entire leadership team remains unwavering in our commitment to the support and success of all students who walk through our doors. Each of you brings unique perspective, experience and diversity to our teaching and learning. This enriches out work, makes us stronger, and provides a driving force to continually work to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included.         To those of you who have graduated, know that while you are leaving the College, you remain a part of our COE community for a lifetime. And to those of you returning in the fall, please know that we are working overtime this summer to improve our student experience and strengthen all the programs that support you and ensure your wellbeing and achievement.         I wish you the very best, and as always do not hesitate to reach out to me at any time via email, LinkedIn, or Instagram.         Warmly,      Dean Jim Pfaendtner",Neutral/Benign

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.    This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.    As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.    We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.    Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.    We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.    Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.

"Megan Coursey <meganpc@comcast.net>  to:	Victoria Cetrone <VCetrone@olgchs.org>  :	May 4, 2024, 12:31 PM  Hello Ms. Cetrone,     Please do not tell Hayden I sent you this email. He doesn't like us contacting his teachers and we encourage him to be as independent as possible with contacting teachers himself. However, it is still our responsibility to ensure that his anxiety and ADHD are under the best control possible and that he is utilizing all tools available to cope with both conditions. Therefore, I am contacting you to be sure there isn't something he is missing. Unfortunately, his anxiety holds him back from reaching out to teachers in situations where he knows he messed up something big.       We all understand that the responsibility for this situation lies entirely on Hayden, and nothing in this email is intended to imply that any of it is on you. My goal is to figure out what Hayden did or didn't do to create this situation so I can provide him with as many tools as possible to avoid it in the future.     The problem is that Hayden had no idea there was going to be a History test yesterday (hence his poor grade). I asked how he was expected to know about the test. He said it was posted in the Google Classroom stream but he keeps forgetting to read that because almost all of the information is redundant. Instead he goes directly to his ""to do"" list in Google Classroom and accesses his assignments there. We had a long talk about the importance of reading the stream each day even if it seems like a waste of time to him since even one piece of critical information (like your test announcement), makes it worth reading daily.     His not reading the stream and going straight to the ""to do"" list is partly a function of his anxiety. He is very anxious to get his homework started each night and has a major anxiety spike if he has to do anything prior to starting on his work. This  plays a role in him skipping the feed and going straight to the ""to do"" list. Again - not making excuses for him, I just want you to understand in case you have any helpful ideas. I am hoping that this experience will make him feel the same urgency over missing information in the stream as he has over getting his homework completed. Additionally, we discussed how he could utilize his planner to help remember to check the stream.     So my question to you is whether there was any other way Hayden should have known about the test. Did he miss an announcement in class? Was it posted elsewhere that he should have seen? If the answer is simply that he needs to be better about checking the stream then I think we have done all we can on that for the time being.",Neutral/Benign

Last summer I had received an email that my GPA (which was at the time below a 3.0) was not high enough to stay in the honors program, and if I wanted to stay I needed to fill out a form. I did so and was allowed to stay in the program. As of right now my semester GPA is the highest it has ever been at a 3.7 (and last semester it was a 3.22) and has increased my cumulative GPA to a 3.17. This still is not within the program's requirements but as is evident by my semester GPA I have made huge strides to bring my GPA back up. I was curious that given my trajectory for maintaining a rising GPA (and ideally reaching a 3.25 by the end of fall '24 would be satisfactory to stay with the program or if I was still at risk of being removed.

Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the overall formal proposal.    I am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online activity:    Be sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A – Collaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about writing step-by-step instructions. The following “must have” list should help you get started on writing instructions if you have not already started:    Introduction and informative title – Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she will be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as time required.    Step-by-step list – Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb followed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may occur if the action is done incorrectly    Format, fonts, and figures – Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users cues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for cautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps, or ones that require an important outcome.    Cautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices – Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of instructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user (e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be broken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning notices in the steps where they apply.    Conclusion – Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as information for additional information or support.    Take a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions, which have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions    Have a great day.

" to:	Disability Resource Office Testing <dro-testing@ncsu.edu>  :	Dec 11, 2023, 11:06 AM  subject:	 CSC 246 Exam  Good Morning,    I wanted to reach out about my 8AM exam this morning that is to be rescheduled for Wednesday. The 2PM option works for me.      Secondly, I'd like to point out the following:   I understand there is nothing that could really be done, and my exam was likely going to be rescheduled regardless. But I think it was highly inconsiderate how it was handled. I know the office received notice from my professor before 8 AM this morning that my exam was not to be taken today; because when I arrived prior to 8AM, I was informed that my professor did not want me taking it today. As a DISABILITY resource office, I would like to think the office would understand the potential harm to one of their registered students for not informing them ASAP. Even if the office did not know until the first person arrived this morning, an email would have been much better. To give you a sense this is where I stand now:  I am a student with ADHD, I took my meds at 6AM so that they could be in effect by 8AM. This means, they will no longer be working around 6-7 PM this evening. I have an exam today at 3:30, so my priority from getting home this morning to 3:30 will be studying for that exam. When I get home around 4:30 or 5, I will have approximately an hour of study time (as my meds will not be working past 6). I have two exams the next day at 8AM and 2PM, so my focus will be my 8AM exam, leaving me with no prep for my 2PM exam. Then, I get home another day at 5:45, after a day of taking my meds at 6AM and will barely be able to study for my NOW Wednesday exam at 2PM. So now, I have almost 2 days to lose all knowledge for my exam. Of course this is a bit of an exaggeration, and since I have lived with ADHD for almost 21 years, I have mechanisms to try and study after my meds are worn off, but I still am not as productive.     I know there was not much you could do, but I want to bring attention to how highly inconsiderate it was to not inform me immediately after knowing the situation. And how ESPECIALLY inconsiderate it was to send me my location notice at 5:19 PM if you guys had already known (which I suspect/hope you did not). I do appreciate your time and effort to reschedule my exam. I just wanted to let you know so that maybe if this happens to another/with another student in the future it can be prevented.",Neutral/Benign

College has been going smoothly for me so far!         I am so sorry to ask on such short notice but I lost track of time and realized I need a recommendation letter for a scholarship application that is due on the 11th. I am REALLY sorry for the short notice but I am really hoping you could write it for me?         If not, I totally understand as it is so last minute. The scholarship is through Shady Grove fertility and as someone carried by a surrogate, I am eligible for the scholarship.         The recommendation letter requirements/outline are:    Please upload one letter of recommendation. The letter must be written by a teacher, coach, or guidance counselor that can speak to your character.    For those with confidential letters of recommendation, please have your teacher, counselor, etc email the letter to ali.williams@sgfertility.com.         Again, I am so sorry for the extremely short notice and hope you have been doing well this past school year!

I will address each of your concerns below, but If you prefer to call and discuss/review, my number is 919.513.3970.    1. I have attached a document that you can complete and return to disability@ncsu.edu that will add your mom to the list of people on your FERPA so we may discuss your eligibility status with her. When you completed the intake on May 7, you only listed Melvin Coursey beside Parent Name(s).  2. On May 19th, the DRO emailed you your Eligibility Summary and listed the required next steps for you to receive accommodations at NCSU. Please review your email for this important information. As stated in that email, I am available to meet if you have additional questions.  3. The DRO does not manage course waitlists, I suggest you keep checking to see if a space opens up in the section you are hoping to enroll in or perhaps try to rearrange a few other courses if taking Calculus I is a priority. It may also be helpful to connect with your Academic Advisor to discuss other possible options.  4. If you would like to change your preferred email at NCSU, click here for instructions.

As you hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty wowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in person, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical to bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.         We will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through the chat.

As long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training. You then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person.    The following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen Tucci.    Completing I-9 Sections 1 & 2  After selecting an orientation , you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right away) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of “Your NC State University Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created”) providing you with information on completing Section 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at home. It is your responsibility to complete Section 1 on time. If you do not complete Section 1, you will not be able to complete Section 2 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form.          Note: Your Social Security number (SSN) will be required to complete Section 1. If you do not have one, you need to apply for one. If you DO need to apply for a Social Security number, you must check the Awaiting Issuance of SSN box in the “U.S. Social Security No”. field in Section 1.      After you have completed Section 1, Section 2 must be completed within three business days after Wellness and Recreation New Student Employee Orientation. An authorized representative of NC State University must complete Section 2 with your original I-9 Acceptable Documents in-person, so you will need to make arrangements to visit the I-9 Center.          Review the government’s list of I-9 Acceptable Documents.         Bring original documents (no copies) from this list; be sure to bring in one selection from List A, OR a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C.    Section 2 Completion The I-9 Center, located in room 101 of the Administrative Services II (2711 Sullivan Drive), is open Monday – Friday from 9:00 am – 4:00 pm. Walk-in appointments are available. If you have questions, please email i9questions@ncsu.edu.           The I-9 Center has made many modifications to their building and their service to best ensure the safety of customers and their staff.  For your safety and the safety of others, the following are required of all individuals visiting the I-9 Hub:    ·   	You must wear a face mask during the appointment,     ·   	You must maintain a distance of least 6 feet from others, and    ·   	You must enter and exit only through the specifically marked doors.    ·   	Please review the following information about safety on the Protect the Pack website and in the How to Return to Campus Safely Guide.      Important information for F-1/J-1 international student employees:     Under U.S. employment law, an employee's attendance of an employer's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings is considered employment hours and must be paid. As such, time spent in Wellness and Recreation’s orientation, onboarding, and trainings (including those completed remotely by the employee such as an online training done at home) will be recorded and paid by NCSU in the week(s) in which they occur. As a reminder, F-1/J-1 international students are limited to 20/hours per week of on-campus employment when school is in session. Therefore, if you have other on-campus employment, you may need to reduce your hours at that job to ensure you do not exceed 20 hours/week total of on-campus employment when you attend Wellness and Recreation's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings. If you have a 0.5 FTE graduate assistantship or are not able to reduce your current on-campus employment hours, you may need to attend the new employer's required events once Summer or Winter break has begun or during a week when there is a break in classes such as Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break, Spring Break, or Spring Holiday. If you have questions about this, please speak with an OIS advisor before attending these events.        For questions related to Form I-9, E-Verify, and New Student Employee Orientation please contact Stephen Tucci at sltucci@ncsu.edu; for questions about your new position, please contact your direct supervisor.       --  Ben Strunk  Assistant Director, Sports Programs  Wellness and Recreation  NC State University  Division of Academic and Student Affairs  P: 919.515.1862  wellrec.ncsu.edu",Urgent/Threatening

I was hoping to get some questions from 2.5 and 2.6, but I do understand that partial fractions can be tricky and that assignment is due tonight.     Hope you are all doing well. It was great to see the people who came to the sessions. Be sure to take the poll about when an optional recorded review session will be if you are interested in attending.

If you have finished it correctly, just ignore this email.  The comments I keep sharing:    Make it public.  I can't see it until you do.    Upload the link to the actual LiveBinder from your account.  I need to see your LiveBinder project, not just all the documents and assignments from this course.    Take all first person references out of your research.  There are no ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc. in professional research.  You use phrases such as ""the authors share....."", or ""according to (author) in (article) ........, or "" research show that....""    Remove all class headings from all assignments.  This should not read like a compilation of class work.  In fact, your name is only on your LiveBinder.    You will not need an outline AND a table of contents.  They are the same, so pick one.    Avoid links inside LiveBinder.  Use as few as possible.  Each new tab should not be another link to open.  Think about your Week 8 presentation and how smoothly you will want to move from one document to the next.    Make sure all pictures and videos are right side up.  Some are posting sideways.    I've only had 2 (out of 20) that I graded.  All others needs at least some tweaking.  So let's just say you edit this weekend and I begin to grade Monday.  Review yours for all the notes above and resubmit when you've had a chance to clean it up.  Message or email me if you have additional questions.

I am working on the LiveBinder Outline assignment and have a couple of questions:  I'm not clear about the difference between the outline itself and the ""one page checklist"" that goes in a separate tab of the LiveBinder. Is it just a difference of format (checkboxes vs structured outline), or is there a content difference (and if so, what is that difference)?  If you are able, would you please take a look at my outline to see if it has what you are looking for?

Below are some ups for the upcoming week.    Solar Eclipse – There is a partial Solar Eclipse visible in North Carolina on Monday 4/8/24 starting around 1:50 pm and ending at 4:30 pm.  As a safety precaution for the children’s eyes, we will not be having any PM outside time tomorrow.  Only the teachers in the Pre-Kindergarten 1 and Pre-kindergarten 2 classrooms will be taking their children outside for whom we have received the consent and release form for.  If we have not received the consent form for your child, we will not be able to take them outside.  Please see a separate email for PK1 and PK2 classrooms for tomorrow.    Week of the Young Child – Starting tomorrow is also the Week of the Young Child.  Below is a snapshot from the monthly newsletter of the daily fun things happening every day.  The classroom outdoor dance party will be happening for all classrooms during their AM outside time since there will be no PM outside time due to the Solar Eclipse.        Drop -Off Time – Friendly reminder our drop off time is in-between 7am to 10am for all full-time students.  For any half day students drop off time is at 8:30am.  If students are going to be past 10am please do let the administration know when we will be expecting our friend.    Pick-Up Time – Friendly reminder the school does close at 6pm.  Please pick up children by 6pm.  Our teachers have to sanitize the classrooms and clean-up before leaving for the day after the children have left their classrooms.

We are requesting parents in our Pre-kindergarten classrooms to avoid sending any cashews and pistachios.  We do have a friend who is severely allergic to cashews and pistachios.  While The Goddard School is an allergen sensitive facility, if either of these items are sent with a child, for the safety of our friend the teachers are told to remove them from classroom immediately.  In addition, we will continue to enforce to the children of no sharing food with friends.      We take all allergies very seriously; we train all our faculty members to identify and familiarize themselves with children’s food allergies and dietary restrictions and ensure that children’s epi-pens, epinephrine, and other medication are up to , labeled, and in a location that is easy for authorized adults to access.     Please make sure all food items for any classroom events are store bought to comply with our school policy and are allergen free.  There are no exceptions to this simply due to the safety of all the children in our school.    If there are any questions, please do reach out to us at any time.

We certainly understand that oversights happen with all the other day to day priorities placed on us as individuals. As a valued member of the Nanticoke Indian Association, “NIA,” we are providing you this gentle reminder.         Through the Nanticoke Indian Association and its members and despite the coronavirus pandemic, we are continuing our work to improve our Tribal awareness, our Tribal community, education opportunities, job training, and employment opportunities along with providing other valuable resources that work to improve the quality of life for our members and the tribe.         The Nanticoke Indian Association Dues assist us in many ways including funding family-oriented activities, cultural sharing, and community events that will resume as soon as it is safe for our members, volunteers, and staff.  These events raise money to support our association, historic museum, student scholarships, and our neighboring tribal community.          According to the following By-Laws adopted on June 7, 2005 and revised on August 5, 2014:         Annual Dues shall be assessed to each Regular and Associate Member in the amount of TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), due on January 1st of each year.   Any member unable to pay his/her dues by January 15th of the current year shall receive a written notice that his/her Membership dues are past due.    If dues are not paid by February 28th of the current year, the Member will be removed from the membership rolls.  Should you be dropped from the membership rolls because of non-payment of dues, reinstatement requires that you complete and submit all paperwork, genealogies, fees, etc.   Current Reinstatement fee is $60.00 - this includes fees and dues.  If the applicant is below the age of 18 years, the reinstatement fee is $35.00 (fees and dues).        We certainly would not want to lose you as a valued member due to a mere oversight on your behalf.  We would like you to know we truly appreciate you as a member and welcome your continued support in the upcoming year.  Also, please know that you can renew for multiple years if this is more convenient for you.         If you feel you have received this notice in error, please contact the NIA office immediately, so we can up our records.
