New Hire,  Our records indicate that you have not completed Section 1 online for your I-9 paperwork and have not completed Section 2 at the I-9 Center on campus. This step is required for you to continue working at Wellness and Recreation and attend trainings on Sunday for Official and/or Scorekeeper.  Please email me back once you completed Section 1!   As long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training. You then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person.  The following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen Tucci.  Completing I-9 Sections 1 & 2 After selecting an orientation date, you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right away) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of Your NC State University Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created) providing you with information on completing Section 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at home.
