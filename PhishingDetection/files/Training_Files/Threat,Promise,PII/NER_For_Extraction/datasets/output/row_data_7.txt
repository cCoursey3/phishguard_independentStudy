Hello pervert, I've sent this message from your iCloud mail.   I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.   Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.   It's been a few months since I installed it on all your devices because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the internet. During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but oene is of special significance to me.
