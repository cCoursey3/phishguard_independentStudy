Subject : I'm waiting to hear from you Good day, I'm Dr. Mrs. Valerie Baptiste-Andrews, married to late Mr. Serge Baptiste-Andrews, who was a businessman and a politician here. Before his sudden death we deposited the sum of $2.8 million dollars in one of the banks here. I am very sick and diagnosed, so i decided to financially support disability and less fortunate people. Give 80% of the funds to disabilities and less fortunate people. The remaining 20% is for your efforts. I want to fulfill the vow i made with my late husband. I will give you more details as soon as i hear from you. Dr. Mrs. Valerie Baptiste-Andrews
