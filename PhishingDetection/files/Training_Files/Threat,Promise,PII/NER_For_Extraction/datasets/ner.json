This step is required for you to continue working at Wellness and Recreation and attend trainings on Sunday for Official and/or Scorekeeper.  Please email me back once you completed Section 1!   As long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training. You then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person.  The following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen Tucci.  Completing I-9 Sections 1 & 2 After selecting an orientation date, you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right away) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of Your NC State University Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created) providing you with information on completing Section 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at home. It is your responsibility to complete Section 1 on time. If you do not complete Section 1, you will not be able to complete Section 2 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form.    Note: Your Social Security number (SSN) will be required to complete Section 1. If you do not have one, you need to apply for one. If you DO need to apply for a Social Security number, you must check the Awaiting Issuance of SSN box in the U.S. Social Security No. field in Section 1.  After you have completed Section 1, Section 2 must be completed within three business days after Wellness and Recreation New Student Employee Orientation. An authorized representative of NC State University must complete Section 2 with your original I-9 Acceptable Documents in-person, so you will need to make arrangements to visit the I-9 Center.    Review the government2019s list of I-9 Acceptable Documents.   Bring original documents (no copies) from this list; be sure to bring in one selection from List A, OR a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C. Section 2 Completion The I-9 Center, located in room 101 of the Administrative Services II (2711 Sullivan Drive), is open Monday 2013 Friday from 9:00 am 2013 4:00 pm. Walk-in appointments are available. If you have questions, please email i9questions@ncsu.edu.     The I-9 Center has made many modifications to their building and their service to best ensure the safety of customers and their staff.  For your safety and the safety of others, the following are required of all individuals visiting the I-9 Hub:   You must wear a face mask during the appointment,     You must maintain a distance of least 6 feet from others, and    You must enter and exit only through the specifically marked doors.    Please review the following information about safety on the Protect the Pack website and in the How to Return to Campus Safely Guide.  Important information for F-1/J-1 international student employees:  Under U.S. employment law, an employee's attendance of an employer's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings is considered employment hours and must be paid. As such, time spent in Wellness and Recreation 2019s orientation, onboarding, and trainings (including those completed remotely by the employee such as an online training done at home) will be recorded and paid by NCSU in the week(s) in which they occur. As a reminder, F-1/J-1 international students are limited to 20/hours per week of on-campus employment when school is in session. Therefore, if you have other on-campus employment, you may need to reduce your hours at that job to ensure you do not exceed 20 hours/week total of on-campus employment when you attend Wellness and Recreation's required orientation, onboarding and/or trainings. If you have a 0.5 FTE graduate assistantship or are not able to reduce your current on-campus employment hours, you may need to attend the new employer's required events once Summer or Winter break has begun or during a week when there is a break in classes such as Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break, Spring Break, or Spring Holiday. If you have questions about this, please speak with an OIS advisor before attending these events.    For questions related to Form I-9, E-Verify, and New Student Employee Orientation please contact Stephen Tucci at sltucci@ncsu.edu; for questions about your new position, please contact your direct supervisor.   -- Ben Strunk Assistant Director, Sports Programs Wellness and Recreation NC State University Division of Academic and Student Affairs P: 919.515.1862 wellrec.ncsu.edu  ",

However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.   Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.   It's been a few months since I installed it on all your devices because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the internet. During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but oene is of special significance to me.   I've recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial poern videos. Given that the questionable genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick perversion.   I doubt you'd want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.   Every number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these videoes - on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email - everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your foermer life.   Don't think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your perversioen might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved punishment to stop you.   I'm some kind of God who sees everything. However, don't panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my mercy is not free.   Transfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0   Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will permanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstall Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure - my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn't be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.   I'll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don't worry, it's very simple. Just google crypto exchange or buy 'Litecoin' and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.   I strongly warn you against the following: * Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail. * Do not contact the police. I have access to all your devices, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published. * Don't try to reset or destroy your devices. As I mentioned above: I'm monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the videoes are published.   Also, don't forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it's impossible to identify me using the provided address.   Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other. And some friendly advice: from now on, don't be so careless about your online security.",

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.  This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the text of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.  As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.  We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.  Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.  We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank label & address, account number,telephone number.  Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.  This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the label of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.  As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.  We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.  Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.  We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.  Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.
