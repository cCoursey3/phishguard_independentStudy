Hi Steve,         Thanks for your help on this. Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:         May 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and 2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up         August 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and 2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.         So our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which for me should have been around  $112,625.         Thanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend.    Megan

Hi Robin,     I'm so sorry - the whole reason we've been trying to get him in sooner was so that if he needs medication we could try it over Christmas break rather than while he is in school. If we have to wait until after break for the follow up it would be better to just stick with the original dates of Dec 20 and 21. Are those still free? If not, do you have an earlier follow up slot? That way Hayden could possibly do his follow up over xmas break and not miss school for that.     If Dec 20 and 21 are no longer available could you just give me a call? That will probably be easiest given how complicated this is.     Thanks  Megan

Hi, Megan,      I was able to confirm November 27th and 28th for Hyden's testing. Now, I would like to schedule your feedback session. I can offer January 3rd at 4PM.

Hello Mrs Smith,     Hayden was officially diagnosed with ADD yesterday and he started Concerta today. He has been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why. Apparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic rigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was diagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing to be sure we aren't missing anything else. I will keep you updated.     Regarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go to a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to go for his exams?     Thanks,  Megan Coursey     Sent from my iPhone

Hi Wolfpack,    I'm pleased to introduce the second Upper-Level Event of the summer -- the University Honors Program is heading back up to Virginia for a weekend in Williamsburg!    Screenshot 2024-05-19 at 1.27.52 PM.png    We'll have a Friday morning departure on June 7th and spend the afternoon exploring Colonial Williamsburg; we'll tour the Governor's Palace, Capitol, and Raleigh Tavern, and we'll visit trade shops, historic houses, and exhibition sites of Williamsburg's 18th century residents. Then we'll check into The Historic Powhatan, a residences resort with amenities including: indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, tennis and racquetball courts, and a mini-golf course.    Saturday will be devoted to Water Country USA, Virginia's largest water park -- wave pools, lazy rivers, water coasters, live entertainment, and more! We'll call it quits when the park closes at 7pm and return to The Historic Powhatan for one more night before our departure on Sunday morning.     Including transportation, two nights at The Historic Powhatan, a half day at Colonial Williamsburg, and a full day at Water Country USA, this trip is available to UHP students at the low cost of $95. If this trip sounds like something you absolutely must add to your summer, please fill out this google form.    Thank you and have a great week!    --  Morgan Budzynski (she/her)  North Carolina State University  M.A. in Rhetoric and Composition C/O 2025  Administrative Assistant, University Honors Program

Good Afternoon,    You do not know me because I am not in one of your classes but I'm reaching out to you on behalf of one of your current students Owen Gabriel Gromyko.    I'm honestly not sure if he is in your class but i know he is in ECE 401 001 and is expecting to take an exam tomorrow at 8:30. If he is not one of your students, I apologize and hope you can redirect me accordingly.    I'm sure this is unusual, but I want to ask if it would even be possible for him to take his exam at least later in the day. He is sick with what I believe is the flu. I've been tending to him for a bit and he is having HORRIBLE muscle fatigue, sweats, pains, etc. All classic signs of the flu. I came over after he took an exam this morning and he told me how bad he was doing and that he had no pain meds for his headache. As his partner I came to help him. I've been on his bedside changing a cool cloth every few minutes because his temperature keeps causing it to heat up so quickly. Unfortunately he doesn't have a thermometer where he lives so I can't even send formal proof of his state.     I told him to try and reach out earlier but he assured me there was no way his exam could be considered for a later time. However, considering the increased emphasis on student health physically and mentally, I was hoping you would consider, if nothing else, allowing him to take the exam at a different hour. As I'm sure you can conclude, being this sick and worrying about an 8:30 am exam is not ideal for the healing process.    I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause or disrespect this may come across as on my part, but I want what is best for him and I'm confident an exam tomorrow is not that, much less at 8:30 in the morning.    I did not copy him on this email because I did not want his hopes to get up; plus I know him and he'd probably try to tough it out instead of risking offending a professor. I hope you will consider what I am suggesting.    Best,  Chloe Coursey

Good Evening Dr. Wang,    I'm reaching out in regards to my final exam. I attempted to set an appointment with the DRO office, but unfortunately they are fully booked for the day of the final exam. I was wondering how we could schedule my final exam to fit both of our schedules. My accomodations include Alternate testing sheets (not scantron/computer generated sheets), 50% extended time, and reduced-distraction settings. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.    Best,  Chloe Coursey

Chloe:  Thank you for reaching out to me. I am more than happy to have you take the final exam with me.    My time is flexible. You can take the final exam with me the next day after the scheduled final exam. Will that day work or a day after that?    Best,    Hong

Good Evening Dr. Heckman,    My name is Chloe Coursey  and you have currently confirmed my accommodations for the semester through the DRO Office. However, before the exam next week, I wanted to reach out and ask if you planned on me taking it via moodle (as it is an online exam) with extended time or if you planned on me going to the DRO office in person.     Thank you,  Chloe Coursey

Chloe,    The exam will be online and you should take the exam with DRO as scheduled.  I'll have the appropriate Moodle time configured for your accommodation.    ssh  --  Sarah Heckman, PhD  Teaching Professor and Director of Undergraduate Programs  Department of Computer Science, NC State University  https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/sesmith5/   she/her

Good Evening,         My name is Chloe Coursey and I am in your physics lab that starts at 7:30pm. I wanted to email you to let you know that I was throwing up not that long ago and as such am unable to make it to lab today. I'll be filing an exemption form to try and accommodate for the lab.      Thank you for your time,    Chloe Coursey

Hi Chloe,  Thank you for letting me know.  Please let me know the earliest that you will be available so that I can accommodate you in either one of my labs or another TA's labs.   I will mark you as absent for now and Prof. Egler might change it to 'EX' once your lab exemption request has been accepted.    Today's lab involved filling out the TA evaluation at go.ncsu.edu/py206_ta_eval   I kindly request you to fill out the same.    Wishing you a speedy recovery.    Regards,  Sharanya

Hello,    I am so so sorry for the late email and I totally understand if you cannot help me with this problem.    So recently, my parents bought a house in the Raleigh area (they currently live in DC) and went to settlement n move in today which I helped with. However, since it is a new house there is no wifi set up, but the wifi should be set up later today (the 28th) as a router and modem is coming  in the mail. i recognize i had the capabilities to finish my webassign assignments before now and I could have emailed earlier than this but with all the move in chaos I honestly forgot to email you about this and lost track of time as I had hopes to finish my syllabus quiz prelab and postlab before now. I am going to request an extension via webassign although I am not sure if i can do that now that the due time has passed. Regardless, I am very sorry for the late notice and this won't happen again. I am normally very on top of my work and I honestly don't know what happened here. I apologize for this inconvenience but still hope you will grant me an extension (although I understand if you deny the request).    Again, I am very sorry for this,  Thank you for your time,  Chloe Coursey

Dear Patients,    We wanted to send out a reminder that our office hours during the next few weeks will be 9:00am to 1:00pm, for emergency patients only.  This includes the week of April 6th.    Due to the importance of social distancing, the government has relaxed many of the rules regarding telehealth visits, and we can now treat some patients via telephone calls or 2-way video conferences during our office hours of 9:00am-1:00pm.  This includes Medicare, Maryland Medicaid, and many commercial insurances (BCBS, Aetna, Cigna, United, to name a few).  If you call our office the doctor on staff will determine if you are a candidate for a telehealth visit.  If so, under the new guidelines, we will bill your insurance for the visit and are waiving your copay.    We hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.  We encourage you to self quarantine, and to follow all CDC guidelines in regard to hand-washing and disinfecting.    Once again, we look forward to the time when we can return to our normal operations.    Sincerely,    Holly M. Gross, M.D.         Click here to unsubscribe from these notifications

Hi Dr. Kamper,     I hope you had a great weekend. I apologize for reaching out with last-minute queries. Currently, my lab partner and I are working on the Results section, and I am a bit confused with the data representation. If I recall correctly, you mentioned that we need a data table for Voltage vs. Force. Could you please confirm if we can report the average of the voltage output for each force? Attached is a screenshot of the table I made, using the averaged voltages.I'm also not sure how to find the RMSE values because I don't know how to calculate the expected force values. Do you mind giving me a hint for this?     Thank you for your time and guidance!    Best,  CN

Hi Cyndy,    You should include all of the data in your table (3 separate measurements for each force). RMSE refers to the fit of the model -   what is the difference between your data points and the value predicted by the line or the quadratic curve predicted by the model  (RMSE for the fit of each model).

Hi Cindy,    my mistake - i meant PHI 325 and had a typo (PHI 375).    your GEP plan looks great. you won't need an additional HUM course in Spring 2025 because PHI 325 will count towards that. and yes, PSY470 will count for a STEM elective    you're all set!  --  Nita Bhave

Owen,    No problem - consider it excused ...      Note that the Moodle site will show a 'zero' but there's nothing I can do about that ...

Hey,    The EEPROMclear file is to clear all the EEPROM variables.     The DataLogger File is to load and run on the arduino to show the Temp on the LCD and save to the EEPROM.     The EEPROMtoEXCEL file is just for showing it on PuTTy serial monitor and you can load it into excel from the PuTTy. You can search some different ways to do it on the internet, I think it would be easier.

Hello pervert, I've sent this message from your iCloud mail.     I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisÐµly.     Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.     It's been a few months since I installed it on all your dÐµviÑÐµs because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the intÐµrnÐµt. During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but Ð¾nÐµ is of special significance to me.     I've recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial ÑÐ¾rn videos. Given that the âquestionableâ genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick ÑÐµrvÐµrsiÐ¾n.     I doubt you'd want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.     Every number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vidÐµÐ¾s - on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email - everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your fÐ¾rmÐµr life.     Don't think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your ÑÐµrvÐµrsiÐ¾n might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved ÑunishmÐµnt to stop you.     I'm some kind of God who sees everything. However, don't panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my mÐµrÑy is not free.     Transfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0     Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will ÑÐµrmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstÐ°ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure - my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn't be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.     I'll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don't worry, it's very simple. Just google âcrypto exchangeâ or "buy Litecoin" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.     I strongly warn you against the following:  * Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.  * Do not contact the police. I have access to all your dÐµviÑÐµs, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.  * Don't try to reset or destroy your dÐµviÑÐµs. As I mentioned above: I'm monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vidÐµÐ¾s are Ñublished.     Also, don't forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it's impossible to identify me using the provided Ð°ddrÐµss.     Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.  And some friendly advice: from now on, don't be so careless about your online security.

Hi Dr. Greenbaum,    I hope this email finds you well. I am working on problem 1.5 on the HW, but I have been struggling to debug the code that was provided. Please see the screenshot below for the error message.     I believe the error is caused by the difference in sample size between the three data sets, but I'm not sure how to make it work (I tried adding an apostrophe to transpose the data but that did not work). I would appreciate a hint to resolve this issue.Thanks,  CN

Hello,    This is DR Maya Ali, I fill in as a clinical guide for the  Department of Disability of Health and Human Services (DHHS).. I give individual and gathering treatment as well as training, evaluation, and scholastic screenings to help understudies with physical and mental handicaps, among others enrolled with the DHHS.  An enormous level of the understudies served by this psychological well-being unit have mental or co-horrible mental inabilities and need emotional wellness backing to find lasting success at the college. Accordingly, the unit gives the expected emotional well-being support while seeing and surveying undiscovered college understudies with scholastic hardships through the scholarly screening and evaluation process. Close to that, I am the overseer of the management, preparing, and coordination of Directing Brain research and Clinical Brain research graduate understudies of the US who have practicum at DHHS and APA-licensed school brain science predoctoral entry level positions.  You have gotten this email since you have a proposal from the College Office to work with me.    Would it be a good idea for you to acknowledge the proposition you'll briefly go about as my own colleague while we assist understudies with handicaps who are disappointed with obliviousness and the absence of administrations. To fulfill any interest you could have, I care about creature government assistance, expressions and culture, kids, social equality and social activity, schooling, climate, catastrophe and philanthropic alleviation, social administrations, and parts more.    This is extremely straightforward work. You will just assist me with mailing a few letters, make a couple of installments at Walmart, and buy a few things when required. This business just requires an hour daily, 2-3 days per week, for $900 week after week. I can't get together for a meeting since I'm currently away, helping handicapped understudies in Australia. By the way, you will be paid ahead of time for all undertakings done for my sake. A portion of my letters/mail will be sent to your home or close by the mailing station for you to get up whenever the timing is ideal. Upon my appearance, we will examine the chance of making this a drawn out work in the event that I am dazzled with your administrations while I'm away.  I received your email through a waitlist from the HR Division to give out positions to a couple of understudies at your college. The college knows about everything.  Mercifully give the underneath Data to apply:    Names:  Address:  Telephone Number:  Age:  Elective email unique in relation to school email:    Anticipating hearing from you soon. Much appreciated.    Heartily.    DR Maya Ali

Good day, I'm Dr. Mrs. Valerie Baptiste-Andrews, married to late Mr. Serge Baptiste-Andrews, who was a businessman and a politician here. Before his sudden death we deposited the sum of $2.8 million dollars in one of the banks here. I am very sick and diagnosed, so i decided to financially support disability and less fortunate people. Give 80% of the funds to disabilities and less fortunate people. The remaining 20% is for your efforts. I want to fulfill the vow i made with my late husband. I will give you more details as soon as i hear from you.  Dr. Mrs. Valerie Baptiste-Andrews

Hi Sourav,    I hope you're doing well! I wanted to ask about the currency assignment. In your feedback, you noted that I didn't have returns for the other lags and didn't have a sensitivity analysis. In my excel, the returns are dependent on cells O3 and O4 which are the values of T and the , so when I adjust it, the returns, the sensitivity adjusted returns, the previous cell, and the Sharpe ratios adjust. I included the hard-coded table of the Sharpe ratios of the return based on the T value.  Would this not count as the sensitivity analysis and returns for other lags?    Best,  Melissa

Dear Member,                                             This letter is a courteous reminder that as of January 15, 2024, we have not received your payment of membership dues for the current 2024 year. We certainly understand that oversights happen with all the other day to day priorities placed on us as individuals. As a valued member of the Nanticoke Indian Association, âNIA,â we are providing you this gentle reminder.         Through the Nanticoke Indian Association and its members and despite the coronavirus pandemic, we are continuing our work to improve our Tribal awareness, our Tribal community, education opportunities, job training, and employment opportunities along with providing other valuable resources that work to improve the quality of life for our members and the tribe.         The Nanticoke Indian Association Dues assist us in many ways including funding family-oriented activities, cultural sharing, and community events that will resume as soon as it is safe for our members, volunteers, and staff.  These events raise money to support our association, historic museum, student scholarships, and our neighboring tribal community.          According to the following By-Laws adopted on June 7, 2005 and revised on August 5, 2014:         Annual Dues shall be assessed to each Regular and Associate Member in the amount of TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), due on January 1st of each year.

If the applicant is below the age of 18 years, the reinstatement fee is $35.00 (fees and dues).        We certainly would not want to lose you as a valued member due to a mere oversight on your behalf.

Hello dears,    I received an email today that there will be a celebration tomorrow night on Hillsborough Street starting at 7pm. In light of this, tomorrow evening's class has been cancelled. I want you all to be able to partake in the festivities if you so please, plus I'm scared of traffic and don't want my car stuck in Dan Allen overnight. This week was going to be Monday screening / Wednesday lecture anyway, so please watch the entirety of Treasure Planet before Wednesday's class. It's such a magical film and well worth viewing as an adult. I will lecture on Wednesday, and then we'll have our final discussion of the semester. If you need anything in the meantime, I'm an email away.    In kindness,    M

Good morning Trisha,        Today is Endangered Species Day and you have an opportunity to protect, conserve, and restore Red Wolves in the wild in North Carolina. As one of the most endangered canids in the world, only found in the wild in North Carolina, what could be a greater purpose on this Endangered Species Day?        To get inspired, watch my brief video below to learn about Red Wolves and why Endangered Species Day is so important.    Endangered Species Day message from NCWF Red Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator  With 17 known Red Wolves in the wild, they are threatened daily by roads and vehicles running throughout their habitat as well as by gunshot. NCWF is committed to addressing these risks.        When you drive on U.S. Highway 64 towards Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, you will likely see electronic signage telling you to slow down because you're in Red Wolf territory. NCWF helped pay for these signs and is advocating for more fencing and wildlife crossings to prevent Red Wolf and other wildlife vehicle collisions.        You may also see signs on private property that read "Prey for the Pack". NCWF works with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners on the Albemarle Peninsula to expand Red Wolf habitat by making habitat improvements that benefit Red Wolves, other wildlife, and the landowner through this cost-share program.        I work every day to raise awareness about Red Wolves by operating the Red Wolf Center in Columbia, North Carolina. However, my favorite way to share the Red Wolf story is taking people out on the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges to experience Red Wolf habitat and all the wildlife that live there.        Come visit me at the Red Wolf Center and in the meantime, I invite you to donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May for Red Wolves, other listed wildlife, and those of greatest conservation need in North Carolina.

Trisha,        I often get questions about the prominent bison in NCWF's logo. It was introduced in 1969 to commemorate the organization's 25th anniversary. It symbolizes NCWF's vision and strengths.        The National Bison Legacy Act, passed by Congress in April 2016, made the bison a U.S. symbol of resilience, unity, and healthy landscapes and communities.        Bison, unlike cattle, do not turn their backs to storms and bad weather, but face directly into the rain and winds. Like the bison, NCWF is agile, strong, dedicated to the cause, and faces a challenge full on.        Maybe one day the bison will be reintroduced in the wild in North Carolina too.        Other extinct species that once called North Carolina home, include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, and Bachman's warbler.        Though these species are some of the few to go fully extinct since colonization, they are not alone in facing threats of extinction, and they are certainly not the only ones to experience significant population declines at the hands of market hunting, habitat loss, and resource scarcity.        Tomorrow is Endangered Species Day and NCWF is raising awareness about endangered, threatened, and species of greatest conservation need in order to prevent further losses. You can make a difference right now by doing two things:        Read more about extinct wildlife in North Carolina  Donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May to support NCWF's work to protect, conserve, and restore listed species and those of greatest conservation need.

Good afternoon to whom it may concern,    My name is Juan Padro, I recently accepted the position as a student trainee for USCIS in the Raleigh-Durham location. I wanted to see if there were any updates for the internship as I have not heard anything in some time and there does not seem to be any updates on USA-Jobs or USA Staffing. If it is just a matter of waiting I understand I was just curious about any updates.    Best Regards,    Juan  (252) 876-6385

Hello Classes,    I've posted the notes and videos from our noon hw session (2.3 problems 4, 7, 6, and 2). Our 1:45pm problem session was, let's say, sparsely attended. I posted notes from the one question from 2.3 that was asked (#5) and then a trig substitution question and another example that someone asked about today. You can find all of this under the HW Hints section of our moodle page.    I was hoping to get some questions from 2.5 and 2.6, but I do understand that partial fractions can be tricky and that assignment is due tonight.     Hope you are all doing well. It was great to see the people who came to the sessions. Be sure to take the poll about when an optional recorded review session will be if you are interested in attending. It looks like it is mostly between Friday at 5pm and Sunday at 5pm.

Hey Sarah!    This is the Children's Message I planned out with Ian. Tell me if you have any changes or just flat out don't like it. Basically we will be comparing David and Goliath to  the Apostles. If you are already confused, just read the attachment below, hopefully it will explain what I mean better than I can right now. Also, I have a concussion and am still trying to figure out if I can participate in the Children's Message. I think I will be able to, but just in case you should figure out if you want to do something else if I am not there. Also, I totally do not care if you don't want to do this. Please don't feel obliged to say yes (or no). Finally, feel free to respond to me over text ð.    Sincerely,    Chloe

Hello Ms. Cetrone,     Please do not tell Hayden I sent you this email. He doesn't like us contacting his teachers and we encourage him to be as independent as possible with contacting teachers himself. However, it is still our responsibility to ensure that his anxiety and ADHD are under the best control possible and that he is utilizing all tools available to cope with both conditions. Therefore, I am contacting you to be sure there isn't something he is missing. Unfortunately, his anxiety holds him back from reaching out to teachers in situations where he knows he messed up something big.       We all understand that the responsibility for this situation lies entirely on Hayden, and nothing in this email is intended to imply that any of it is on you. My goal is to figure out what Hayden did or didn't do to create this situation so I can provide him with as many tools as possible to avoid it in the future.     The problem is that Hayden had no idea there was going to be a History test yesterday (hence his poor grade). I asked how he was expected to know about the test. He said it was posted in the Google Classroom stream but he keeps forgetting to read that because almost all of the information is redundant. Instead he goes directly to his "to do" list in Google Classroom and accesses his assignments there. We had a long talk about the importance of reading the stream each day even if it seems like a waste of time to him since even one piece of critical information (like your test announcement), makes it worth reading daily.     His not reading the stream and going straight to the "to do" list is partly a function of his anxiety. He is very anxious to get his homework started each night and has a major anxiety spike if he has to do anything prior to starting on his work. This  plays a role in him skipping the feed and going straight to the "to do" list. Again - not making excuses for him, I just want you to understand in case you have any helpful ideas. I am hoping that this experience will make him feel the same urgency over missing information in the stream as he has over getting his homework completed. Additionally, we discussed how he could utilize his planner to help remember to check the stream.     So my question to you is whether there was any other way Hayden should have known about the test. Did he miss an announcement in class? Was it posted elsewhere that he should have seen? If the answer is simply that he needs to be better about checking the stream then I think we have done all we can on that for the time being.

Good Morning Ms. Portugallo,    My name is Chloe Coursey and I'm an intern with the SVIP program. I have one question regarding the orientation, does it end around noon or 5pm? I was reading the emails again and I understand that there is a guest speaker until about 11:30 but I'm unclear if orientation ends after that or if it continues until 5.    Thank you for your time,  Chloe Coursey

Good morning and welcome to campus (or back to campus, as the case may be)!          We're delighted you're here and looking forward to a fantastic Forum this semester. As you hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty wowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in person, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical to bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.         We will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through the chat.         Make sure you register ahead of time for the session you plan to attend.

Good Morning,    I wanted to reach out about my 8AM exam this morning that is to be rescheduled for Wednesday. The 2PM option works for me.      Secondly, I'd like to point out the following:   I understand there is nothing that could really be done, and my exam was likely going to be rescheduled regardless. But I think it was highly inconsiderate how it was handled. I know the office received notice from my professor before 8 AM this morning that my exam was not to be taken today; because when I arrived prior to 8AM, I was informed that my professor did not want me taking it today. As a DISABILITY resource office, I would like to think the office would understand the potential harm to one of their registered students for not informing them ASAP. Even if the office did not know until the first person arrived this morning, an email would have been much better. To give you a sense this is where I stand now:  I am a student with ADHD, I took my meds at 6AM so that they could be in effect by 8AM. This means, they will no longer be working around 6-7 PM this evening. I have an exam today at 3:30, so my priority from getting home this morning to 3:30 will be studying for that exam. When I get home around 4:30 or 5, I will have approximately an hour of study time (as my meds will not be working past 6). I have two exams the next day at 8AM and 2PM, so my focus will be my 8AM exam, leaving me with no prep for my 2PM exam. Then, I get home another day at 5:45, after a day of taking my meds at 6AM and will barely be able to study for my NOW Wednesday exam at 2PM. So now, I have almost 2 days to lose all knowledge for my exam. Of course this is a bit of an exaggeration, and since I have lived with ADHD for almost 21 years, I have mechanisms to try and study after my meds are worn off, but I still am not as productive.     I know there was not much you could do, but I want to bring attention to how highly inconsiderate it was to not inform me immediately after knowing the situation. And how ESPECIALLY inconsiderate it was to send me my location notice at 5:19 PM if you guys had already known (which I suspect/hope you did not). I do appreciate your time and effort to reschedule my exam. I just wanted to let you know so that maybe if this happens to another/with another student in the future it can be prevented.

Hello Erin,    I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to give you a heads-up that our distributor will be dropping off the inventory for your system at your residence on March 28th. You do not have to be on-site nor do you have to receive it. This is just to keep you in the loop.    The distributor usually leaves the inventory in the driveway but as out of the way as possible. There will be 1-2 pallets of panels and a few boxes with the other equipment needed. All equipment is expected to take no more than 1 car space.    We will also have someone from 8MSolar come to your residence the day before the installation to count and verify all of the inventory delivered on-site.    Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.    Thanks,    Rana

Good morning Courtney,  I tried calling the number listed below but the voicemail box was full so I was unable to leave a message.   I will address each of your concerns below, but If you prefer to call and discuss/review, my number is 919.513.3970.    1. I have attached a document that you can complete and return to disability@ncsu.edu that will add your mom to the list of people on your FERPA so we may discuss your eligibility status with her. When you completed the intake on May 7, you only listed Melvin Coursey beside Parent Name(s).  2. On May 19th, the DRO emailed you your Eligibility Summary and listed the required next steps for you to receive accommodations at NCSU. Please review your email for this important information. As stated in that email, I am available to meet if you have additional questions.  3. The DRO does not manage course waitlists, I suggest you keep checking to see if a space opens up in the section you are hoping to enroll in or perhaps try to rearrange a few other courses if taking Calculus I is a priority. It may also be helpful to connect with your Academic Advisor to discuss other possible options.  4. If you would like to change your preferred email at NCSU, click here for instructions.     Please let me know if you have additional questions,  Leslie

Good Afternoon Dr Wang,    I just wanted to reach out and figure out a time that works for you that I can take my final exam next Thursday!    Thanks,  Chloe Coursey

Hi Chloe, For Assignment 3A, I am not asking you to make up any background experience. Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the overall formal proposal.    I am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online activity:    Be sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A - Collaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about writing step-by-step instructions. The following âmust haveâ list should help you get started on writing instructions if you have not already started:    Introduction and informative title - Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she will be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as time required.    Step-by-step list - Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb followed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may occur if the action is done incorrectly    Format, fonts, and figures - Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users cues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for cautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps, or ones that require an important outcome.    Cautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices - Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of instructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user (e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be broken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning notices in the steps where they apply.    Conclusion - Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as information for additional information or support.    Take a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions, which have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions    Have a great day.

One very sharp classmate pointed out that I'm already off schedule!  I always struggle to keep up with college schedules.  Monday is almost never Day 1 and I often forget our "pauses"!  I've attached the spring schedule posted in Module 0, showing that your intro video and initial Discussion Post are actually due Saturday.  So..........forget that last email reminder and have a great evening (good night's sleep!)    Cheri Ogden

Good afternoon,    Today we discovered that most of our incoming phone lines are not working, including our pool phone line. We have contacted our phone company, and they will be out tomorrow, Saturday, May 25, 2024.    Unfortunately, we can not open the pool today, as the phone pool is not working. We are hopeful that after the visit from the phone company tomorrow, we will be able to open the pool. Please watch for email updates throughout the weekend.    Thank you for your patience while our office phones are experiencing issues. If you need to reach us, our email is working. Our email address is maa900waterford@maac.com.    Thank you so much for your understanding and please check your email for updates.    MAA 900 Waterford

Happy Afternoon Students!!!      I just wanted to notify you that next week is spring break for the University.   Unless your instructor has said otherwise, no assignments are due during this time. Please use this time to take a breather or catch up on work if needed.       I also wanted to let all students know that during spring break (because of the Masters), the University pretty much shuts down, and the majority of offices are closed.     I want to let everyone know that I will not be available next week, but there will be rotating success staff that will be responding to emails at the AUO Success email. However, please know that because most offices on campus will be closed, any issues or adjustments concerning registration must occur after spring break.     During this pause, please remember to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take a walk, watch a movie, eat some good food, and get some rest. You all work so hard and you have earned that break! ð    Thank you,    Gina Bolin  Director of Online Student Support Services  Augusta University Online  Email: gbolin@augusta.edu  Phone: 706.729.2125       Book time to meet with me

Dear Friend      My apology for sending this unsolicited mail to you; I actually got your e-mail contact through my online exploration for proficient business persons and l decided to contact you directly about this business venture. I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.    This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.    As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.    We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.    Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.    We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.    Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.

Good morning,    Welcome to the team!  We are so excited for you to join us this summer! I wanted to begin walking you through the onboarding process. I just initiated a background check and drug screening via email. It is important to get this done as soon as possible.    Please see the details below regarding a background check and drug screening. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.    You should have received an email regarding the following:    Background Check  Drug Screening  You will need to fill out the personal information required for Sterling to complete the background check. The entire process should be completed in no more than 5 days. The first 48 hours should be dedicated to ensuring the background check portion is completed by you. Please send me an email once you have completed the background check portion, as this will prompt us to launch out the drug screening portion of your clearance. This will permit you 72 hours to take the drug screening test. Once you enter your preferred address, this will automatically generate the closest drug screening locations to your home address. Please ensure the address you utilize is the address you physically reside in (even if just currently), so that you can get the nearest location. A chain of custody form will then be given to you to take to the laboratory, along with proper identification.    Please ensure you notify us if the following occurs:    You cannot fill out the background check within the given 48 hours.  You cannot take the exam within the given 72 hours (either for personal reasons or unable to secure an appointment). Timely completion of the drug screening should be ensured, as we do expect a week or two turnaround time frames to have results provided back to us.  If you did not receive this email, please let me know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.    Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Alums, I am Mr. Jones wife - Karen, I teach at Quince Orchard - and you might have heard that Mr. Jones is retiring in June.  I am hoping to compile messages for him, from the alum and even current students, so the alumni office helped me gather some emails.  I am obviously very proud of all that he has built at Good Counsel, and he is so proud of you and all that you have gone on to accomplish.  He would love to hear from you about any memories or feelings you have about the program and your time with him!  IF you would be willing to send him a message - feel free to write me a note, that I will compile into some kind of memory book.  I am also hoping that you can help spread the word - feel free to forward this message to any students you know from the STEM classes who might want to send a message and if you have any pictures I would love those as well!    Thanks,   Karen

Hello Parents,    I hope you are having a good day. A few parents have asked about the number of cups to bring in each day. Per sanitation we ask parents to bring in three cups per day for their child. Sanitation requires us to use a new cup for each use and does not allow us to reuse cups throughout the day. Each cup should be labeled with your child's first and last name and the date.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

This email serves as a heads-up regarding the upcoming electrical panel upgrade scheduled for Building 12 on June 6 and expected to be completed by August 12.    The current electrical panel has reached the end of its lifespan and requires an upgrade to ensure continued safe and reliable power supply for the building.     What to Expect:    There will be brief power outages during the upgrade process. A detailed schedule of these outages will be circulated closer to the start date.  The work will primarily take place in the designated electrical room and may cause minimal noise disruption.  For safety reasons, access to the electrical room will be restricted during the upgrade.  Preparation:    We encourage you to save any unsaved work and shut down electronic equipment before the scheduled power outages.  If you have any critical equipment that cannot tolerate power interruptions, please contact the Facilities Department at [Phone Number or Email Address] to discuss alternative arrangements.  We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we complete this necessary upgrade.    Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the Facilities Department.    Sincerely,    The Facilities Department
