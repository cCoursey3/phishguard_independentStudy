        "text": "Hi Steve,         Thanks for your help on this. Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:         May 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and 2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up         August 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and 2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.         So our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which for me should have been around  $112,625.         Thanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend.

If we have to wait until after break for the follow up it would be better to just stick with the original dates of Dec 20 and 21. Are those still free? If not, do you have an earlier follow up slot? That way Hayden could possibly do his follow up over xmas break and not miss school for that.     If Dec 20 and 21 are no longer available could you just give me a call? That will probably be easiest given how complicated this is.     Thanks  Megan",

He has been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why. Apparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic rigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was diagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing to be sure we aren't missing anything else. I will keep you updated.     Regarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go to a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to go for his exams?

Screenshot 2024-05-19 at 1.27.52 PM.png    We'll have a Friday morning departure on June 7th and spend the afternoon exploring Colonial Williamsburg; we'll tour the Governor's Palace, Capitol, and Raleigh Tavern, and we'll visit trade shops, historic houses, and exhibition sites of Williamsburg's 18th century residents. Then we'll check into The Historic Powhatan, a residences resort with amenities including: indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, tennis and racquetball courts, and a mini-golf course.    Saturday will be devoted to Water Country USA, Virginia's largest water park -- wave pools, lazy rivers, water coasters, live entertainment, and more! We'll call it quits when the park closes at 7pm and return to The Historic Powhatan for one more night before our departure on Sunday morning.     Including transportation, two nights at The Historic Powhatan, a half day at Colonial Williamsburg, and a full day at Water Country USA, this trip is available to UHP students at the low cost of $95.

I'm honestly not sure if he is in your class but i know he is in ECE 401 001 and is expecting to take an exam tomorrow at 8:30. If he is not one of your students, I apologize and hope you can redirect me accordingly.    I'm sure this is unusual, but I want to ask if it would even be possible for him to take his exam at least later in the day. He is sick with what I believe is the flu. I've been tending to him for a bit and he is having HORRIBLE muscle fatigue, sweats, pains, etc. All classic signs of the flu. I came over after he took an exam this morning and he told me how bad he was doing and that he had no pain meds for his headache. As his partner I came to help him. I've been on his bedside changing a cool cloth every few minutes because his temperature keeps causing it to heat up so quickly. Unfortunately he doesn't have a thermometer where he lives so I can't even send formal proof of his state.     I told him to try and reach out earlier but he assured me there was no way his exam could be considered for a later time. However, considering the increased emphasis on student health physically and mentally, I was hoping you would consider, if nothing else, allowing him to take the exam at a different hour. As I'm sure you can conclude, being this sick and worrying about an 8:30 am exam is not ideal for the healing process.    I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause or disrespect this may come across as on my part, but I want what is best for him and I'm confident an exam tomorrow is not that, much less at 8:30 in the morning.    I did not copy him on this email because I did not want his hopes to get up; plus I know him and he'd probably try to tough it out instead of risking offending a professor. I hope you will consider what I am suggesting.    Best,  Chloe Coursey",

This includes the week of April 6th.    Due to the importance of social distancing, the government has relaxed many of the rules regarding telehealth visits, and we can now treat some patients via telephone calls or 2-way video conferences during our office hours of 9:00am-1:00pm.  This includes Medicare, Maryland Medicaid, and many commercial insurances (BCBS, Aetna, Cigna, United, to name a few).  If you call our office the doctor on staff will determine if you are a candidate for a telehealth visit.  If so, under the new guidelines, we will bill your insurance for the visit and are waiving your copay.    We hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.  We encourage you to self quarantine, and to follow all CDC guidelines in regard to hand-washing and disinfecting.

In your feedback, you noted that I didn't have returns for the other lags and didn't have a sensitivity analysis. In my excel, the returns are dependent on cells O3 and O4 which are the values of T and the , so when I adjust it, the returns, the sensitivity adjusted returns, the previous cell, and the Sharpe ratios adjust. I included the hard-coded table of the Sharpe ratios of the return based on the T value.  Would this not count as the sensitivity analysis and returns for other lags?    Best,  Melissa",

We certainly understand that oversights happen with all the other day to day priorities placed on us as individuals. As a valued member of the Nanticoke Indian Association, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNIA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we are providing you this gentle reminder.         Through the Nanticoke Indian Association and its members and despite the coronavirus pandemic, we are continuing our work to improve our Tribal awareness, our Tribal community, education opportunities, job training, and employment opportunities along with providing other valuable resources that work to improve the quality of life for our members and the tribe.         The Nanticoke Indian Association Dues assist us in many ways including funding family-oriented activities, cultural sharing, and community events that will resume as soon as it is safe for our members, volunteers, and staff.  These events raise money to support our association, historic museum, student scholarships, and our neighboring tribal community.          According to the following By-Laws adopted on June 7, 2005 and revised on August 5, 2014:         Annual Dues shall be assessed to each Regular and Associate Member in the amount of TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), due on January 1st of each year.   Any member unable to pay his/her dues by January 15th of the current year shall receive a written notice that his/her Membership dues are past due.    If dues are not paid by February 28th of the current year, the Member will be removed from the membership rolls.  Should you be dropped from the membership rolls because of non-payment of dues, reinstatement requires that you complete and submit all paperwork, genealogies, fees, etc.   Current Reinstatement fee is $60.00 - this includes fees and dues.  If the applicant is below the age of 18 years, the reinstatement fee is $35.00 (fees and dues).        We certainly would not want to lose you as a valued member due to a mere oversight on your behalf.  We would like you to know we truly appreciate you as a member and welcome your continued support in the upcoming year.  Also, please know that you can renew for multiple years if this is more convenient for you.         If you feel you have received this notice in error, please contact the NIA office immediately, so we can update our records.

As one of the most endangered canids in the world, only found in the wild in North Carolina, what could be a greater purpose on this Endangered Species Day?        To get inspired, watch my brief video below to learn about Red Wolves and why Endangered Species Day is so important.    Endangered Species Day message from NCWF Red Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator  With 17 known Red Wolves in the wild, they are threatened daily by roads and vehicles running throughout their habitat as well as by gunshot. NCWF is committed to addressing these risks.        When you drive on U.S. Highway 64 towards Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, you will likely see electronic signage telling you to slow down because you're in Red Wolf territory. NCWF helped pay for these signs and is advocating for more fencing and wildlife crossings to prevent Red Wolf and other wildlife vehicle collisions.        You may also see signs on private property that read \"Prey for the Pack\". NCWF works with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners on the Albemarle Peninsula to expand Red Wolf habitat by making habitat improvements that benefit Red Wolves, other wildlife, and the landowner through this cost-share program.        I work every day to raise awareness about Red Wolves by operating the Red Wolf Center in Columbia, North Carolina. However, my favorite way to share the Red Wolf story is taking people out on the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges to experience Red Wolf habitat and all the wildlife that live there.        Come visit me at the Red Wolf Center and in the meantime, I invite you to donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May for Red Wolves, other listed wildlife, and those of greatest conservation need in North Carolina.        We are lucky here in North Carolina, to be home to the world's only wild Red Wolves. Let's not let them go extinct on our watch!        Thank you for caring and I hope to see you at the Red Wolf Center soon!

        "text": "Trisha,        I often get questions about the prominent bison in NCWF's logo. It was introduced in 1969 to commemorate the organization's 25th anniversary. It symbolizes NCWF's vision and strengths.        The National Bison Legacy Act, passed by Congress in April 2016, made the bison a U.S. symbol of resilience, unity, and healthy landscapes and communities.        Bison, unlike cattle, do not turn their backs to storms and bad weather, but face directly into the rain and winds. Like the bison, NCWF is agile, strong, dedicated to the cause, and faces a challenge full on.        Maybe one day the bison will be reintroduced in the wild in North Carolina too.        Other extinct species that once called North Carolina home, include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, and Bachman's warbler.        Though these species are some of the few to go fully extinct since colonization, they are not alone in facing threats of extinction, and they are certainly not the only ones to experience significant population declines at the hands of market hunting, habitat loss, and resource scarcity.        Tomorrow is Endangered Species Day and NCWF is raising awareness about endangered, threatened, and species of greatest conservation need in order to prevent further losses. You can make a difference right now by doing two things:        Read more about extinct wildlife in North Carolina  Donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May to support NCWF's work to protect, conserve, and restore listed species and those of greatest conservation need.      Losing wildlife affects us all. Together, we can make a difference.        Thank you, Tim    Donate  Tim Gestwicki    CEO    North Carolina Wildlife Federation    1346 St. Julien Street    Charlotte, NC 28205    Phone (704) 332-5696     Web www.ncwf.org Email Tim@ncwf.org    P.S. Consider a recurring automated monthly donation. It is the most efficient and effective way to donate to NCWF and help endangered wildlife in North Carolina on Endangered Species Day and throughout the year.",

I posted notes from the one question from 2.3 that was asked (#5) and then a trig substitution question and another example that someone asked about today. You can find all of this under the HW Hints section of our moodle page.    I was hoping to get some questions from 2.5 and 2.6, but I do understand that partial fractions can be tricky and that assignment is due tonight.     Hope you are all doing well.

We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.         We will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through the chat.

There will be 1-2 pallets of panels and a few boxes with the other equipment needed. All equipment is expected to take no more than 1 car space.

Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the overall formal proposal.    I am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online activity:    Be sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A - Collaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about writing step-by-step instructions. The following \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have\u00e2\u0080\u009d list should help you get started on writing instructions if you have not already started:    Introduction and informative title - Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she will be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as time required.    Step-by-step list - Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb followed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may occur if the action is done incorrectly    Format, fonts, and figures - Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users cues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for cautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps, or ones that require an important outcome.    Cautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices - Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of instructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user (e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be broken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning notices in the steps where they apply.    Conclusion - Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as information for additional information or support.    Take a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions, which have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions    Have a great day.

Unless your instructor has said otherwise, no assignments are due during this time. Please use this time to take a breather or catch up on work if needed.       I also wanted to let all students know that during spring break (because of the Masters), the University pretty much shuts down, and the majority of offices are closed.     I want to let everyone know that I will not be available next week, but there will be rotating success staff that will be responding to emails at the AUO Success email. However, please know that because most offices on campus will be closed, any issues or adjustments concerning registration must occur after spring break.     During this pause, please remember to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take a walk, watch a movie, eat some good food, and get some rest. You all work so hard and you have earned that break! \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082    Thank you,    Gina Bolin  Director of Online Student Support Services  Augusta University Online  Email: gbolin@augusta.edu  Phone: 706.729.2125       Book time to meet with me",

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.    This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.    As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.    We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.    Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.    We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.    Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.

I just initiated a background check and drug screening via email. It is important to get this done as soon as possible.    Please see the details below regarding a background check and drug screening. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.    You should have received an email regarding the following:    Background Check  Drug Screening  You will need to fill out the personal information required for Sterling to complete the background check. The entire process should be completed in no more than 5 days. The first 48 hours should be dedicated to ensuring the background check portion is completed by you. Please send me an email once you have completed the background check portion, as this will prompt us to launch out the drug screening portion of your clearance. This will permit you 72 hours to take the drug screening test. Once you enter your preferred address, this will automatically generate the closest drug screening locations to your home address. Please ensure the address you utilize is the address you physically reside in (even if just currently), so that you can get the nearest location. A chain of custody form will then be given to you to take to the laboratory, along with proper identification.    Please ensure you notify us if the following occurs:    You cannot fill out the background check within the given 48 hours.  You cannot take the exam within the given 72 hours (either for personal reasons or unable to secure an appointment). Timely completion of the drug screening should be ensured, as we do expect a week or two turnaround time frames to have results provided back to us.

What to Expect:    There will be brief power outages during the upgrade process. A detailed schedule of these outages will be circulated closer to the start date.  The work will primarily take place in the designated electrical room and may cause minimal noise disruption.  For safety reasons, access to the electrical room will be restricted during the upgrade.  Preparation:    We encourage you to save any unsaved work and shut down electronic equipment before the scheduled power outages.  If you have any critical equipment that cannot tolerate power interruptions, please contact the Facilities Department at [Phone Number or Email Address] to discuss alternative arrangements.  We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we complete this necessary upgrade.    Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the Facilities Department.    Sincerely,    The Facilities Department",
