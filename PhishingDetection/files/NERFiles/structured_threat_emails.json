As \nyou hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty \nwowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in \nperson, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical \nto bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings \nonline for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better \nreach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time \nconflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's \nsession and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend \ntoday or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email \nadditional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live. \nWe will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start \ngreeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through \nthe chat. \nMake sure you register ahead of time for the session you plan to attend. \n\u2022 Zoom registration link \n for Monday, August 16 at 3:00 PM \n\u2022 Zoom registration link \nfor Tuesday, August 17 at 3:00 PM \nAlso, here is a link to the USP 110 syllabus for your review, in case you haven\u2019t seen it \nyet. \nThanks! \n",

This step is \nrequired for you to continue working at Wellness and Recreation and attend trainings on \nSunday for Official and/or Scorekeeper. \n \nPlease email me back once you completed Section 1!  \n \nAs long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training. \nYou then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person. \n \nThe following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen \nTucci. \n \nCompleting I-9 Sections 1 & 2 \nAfter selecting an orientation date, you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right \naway) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of \u201cYour NC State \nUniversity Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created\u201d) providing you with information on completing \nSection 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at \nhome. It is your responsibility to complete Section 1 on time. If you do not complete Section 1, you will not \nbe able to complete Section 2 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form.  \n  \nNote: Your Social Security number (SSN) will be required to complete Section 1. If you do not have one, \nyou need to apply for one. If you DO need to apply for a Social Security number, you must check the \nAwaiting Issuance of SSN box in the \u201cU.S. Social Security No\u201d. field in Section 1. \n \nAfter you have completed Section 1, Section 2 must be completed within three business days after \nWellness and Recreation New Student Employee Orientation. An authorized representative of NC \nState University must complete Section 2 with your original I-9 Acceptable Documents in-person, so you \nwill need to make arrangements to visit the I-9 Center.  \n  \nReview the government\u2019s list of I-9 Acceptable Documents. \n  \nBring original documents (no copies) from this list; be sure to bring in one selection from List A, OR a \ncombination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C. \nSection 2 Completion The I-9 Center, located in room 101 of the Administrative Services II (2711 \nSullivan Drive), is open Monday \u2013 Friday from 9:00 am \u2013 4:00 pm. Walk-in appointments are available. If \nyou have questions, please email i9questions@ncsu.edu.   \n  \nThe I-9 Center has made many modifications to their building and their service to best ensure the safety \nof customers and their staff.  For your safety and the safety of others, the following are required of all \nindividuals visiting the I-9 Hub: \n\u00b7   You must wear a face mask during the appointment,  \n\u00b7   You must maintain a distance of least 6 feet from others, and \n\u00b7   You must enter and exit only through the specifically marked doors. \n\u00b7   Please review the following information about safety on the Protect the Pack website and in the \nHow to Return to Campus Safely Guide. \n \nImportant information for F-1/J-1 international student employees:  \nUnder U.S. employment law, an employee's attendance of an employer's required orientation, onboarding \nand/or trainings is considered employment hours and must be paid. As such, time spent in Wellness and \nRecreation\u2019s orientation, onboarding, and trainings (including those completed remotely by the employee \nsuch as an online training done at home) will be recorded and paid by NCSU in the week(s) in which they \noccur. As a reminder, F-1/J-1 international students are limited to 20/hours per week of on-campus \nemployment when school is in session. Therefore, if you have other on-campus employment, you may \nneed to reduce your hours at that job to ensure you do not exceed 20 hours/week total of on-campus \nemployment when you attend Wellness and Recreation's required orientation, onboarding and/or \ntrainings. If you have a 0.5 FTE graduate assistantship or are not able to reduce your current on-campus \nemployment hours, you may need to attend the new employer's required events once Summer or Winter \nbreak has begun or during a week when there is a break in classes such as Fall Break, Thanksgiving \nBreak, Spring Break, or Spring Holiday. If you have questions about this, please speak with an OIS \nadvisor before attending these events.   \n \nFor questions related to Form I-9, E-Verify, and New Student Employee Orientation please contact \nStephen Tucci at sltucci@ncsu.edu; for questions about your new position, please contact your direct \nsupervisor.  \n \n-- \nBen Strunk \nAssistant Director, Sports Programs \nWellness and Recreation \nNC State University \nDivision of Academic and Student Affairs \nP: 919.515.1862 \nwellrec.ncsu.edu \n \n",

The 2PM option works for me. \nSecondly, I'd like to point out the following: \nI understand there is nothing that could really be done, and my exam was likely going to \nbe rescheduled regardless. But I think it was highly inconsiderate how it was handled. I \nknow the office received notice from my professor before 8 AM this morning that my \nexam was not to be taken today; because when I arrived prior to 8AM, I was informed \nthat my professor did not want me taking it today. As a DISABILITY resource office, I \nwould like to think the office would understand the potential harm to one of their \nregistered students for not informing them ASAP. Even if the office did not know until \nthe first person arrived this morning, an email would have been much better. To give \nyou a sense this is where I stand now: \nI am a student with ADHD, I took my meds at 6AM so that they could be in effect by \n8AM. This means, they will no longer be working around 6-7 PM this evening. I have an \nexam today at 3:30, so my priority from getting home this morning to 3:30 will be \nstudying for that exam. When I get home around 4:30 or 5, I will have approximately an \nhour of study time (as my meds will not be working past 6). I have two exams the next \nday at 8AM and 2PM, so my focus will be my 8AM exam, leaving me with no prep for \nmy 2PM exam. Then, I get home another day at 5:45, after a day of taking my meds at \n6AM and will barely be able to study for my NOW Wednesday exam at 2PM. So now, I \nhave almost 2 days to lose all knowledge for my exam. Of course this is a bit of an \nexaggeration, and since I have lived with ADHD for almost 21 years, I have \nmechanisms to try and study after my meds are worn off, but I still am not as \nproductive.  \nI know there was not much you could do, but I want to bring attention to how highly \ninconsiderate it was to not inform me immediately after knowing the situation. And how \nESPECIALLY inconsiderate it was to send me my location notice at 5:19 PM if you guys \nhad already known (which I suspect/hope you did not). I do appreciate your time and \neffort to reschedule my exam. I just wanted to let you know so that maybe if this \nhappens to another/with another student in the future it can be prevented. \nThank you for your time, \nChloe Coursey \n \n",

Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the \noverall formal proposal.\nI am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online \nactivity:\nBe sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A \u2013 \nCollaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about \nwriting step-by-step instructions. The following \u201cmust have\u201d list should help you get started on \nwriting instructions if you have not already started:\nIntroduction and informative title \u2013 Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she \nwill be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as \ntime required.\nStep-by-step list \u2013 Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb \nfollowed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may \noccur if the action is done incorrectly\nFormat, fonts, and figures \u2013 Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users \ncues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for \ncautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps, \nor ones that require an important outcome.\nCautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices \u2013 Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of \ninstructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user \n(e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be \nbroken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning \nnotices in the steps where they apply.\nConclusion \u2013 Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as \ninformation for additional information or support.\nTake a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions, \nwhich have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing \n- https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions \nHave a great day.\nJamie\n-- \nJamie Larsen \nDirector Professional Writing Program \nSenior Lecturer, Department of English \nNC State University, Tompkins 104 \n919-515-4118 (office)\n919-621-8483 (cell)\njlarsen@ncsu.edu\n",

I apologize for reaching out with last-minute queries. \nCurrently, my lab partner and I are working on the Results section, and I am a bit \nconfused with the data representation. If I recall correctly, you mentioned that we need \na data table for Voltage vs. Force. Could you please confirm if we can report the \naverage of the voltage output for each force? Attached is a screenshot of the table I \nmade, using the averaged voltages. \n \n[Image: Screen Shot 2023-11-13 at 9.28.44 PM.png] \n \nI'm also not sure how to find the RMSE values because I don't know how to calculate \nthe expected force values.

I don't think I have taken PHI 375 before. But I took PHI 325, which was \nrequired in the BME curriculum.  \nYes, I took STS 323 for my IDP GEP! Would STS323 also count for my Global \nKnowledge GEP? Both of them were listed in the class description, but please let me \nknow if I need to take an extra class. \n Below is my GEP \nplan: \nI'm taking PSY200 (Social Sciences). This summer I will take STS 210 (US Diversity) and MUS 180 \n(Additional Breadth). \nI have only taken one Humanities class (HI 337) but I will plan to take another one in Spring 2025. \nI'm planning to take PSY470 this fall semester, which I believe can count as my STEM Elective [link: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cm9VQQeoFE7yuMmbzJl1NICmR-P3J_iQ-\nzkjrI6XETQ/edit#gid=0] for BME curriculum. \nI also need to take one more PE class, which I plan to take in Spring 2025. \nI hope this helps! Please let me know if I missed anything. Thank you! \nBest, \nCN \n \n-- \nCindy Nguyen \nBiomedical Engineering '25 \nGrand Challenges & Pack Promise Scholar \n",

However, you can benefit from it, \nif you will act wis\u0435ly. \n  \nHave you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and \nsmartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides \naccess to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, \niOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I\u2019m getting at. \n  \nIt\u2019s been a few months since I installed it on all your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s because you were not quite \nchoosy about what links to click on the int\u0435rn\u0435t. During this period, I\u2019ve learned about all \naspects of your private life, but \u043en\u0435 is of special significance to me. \n  \nI\u2019ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial \u0440\u043ern videos. Given \nthat the \u201cquestionable\u201d genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have \nsick \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en. \n  \nI doubt you\u2019d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can \ndo it in a few clicks. \n  \nEvery number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vid\u0435\u043es \u2013 on WhatsApp, on \nTelegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email \u2013 everywhere. It is going to be a \ntsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your f\u043erm\u0435r life. \n  \nDon\u2019t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your \u0440\u0435rv\u0435rsi\u043en \nmight lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved \u0440unishm\u0435nt to stop you. \n  \nI\u2019m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don\u2019t panic. As we know, God is \nmerciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my m\u0435r\u0441y is not free. \n  \nTransfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) \nwallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0 \n  \nOnce I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will \u0440\u0435rmanently delete all videos \ncompromising you, uninst\u0430ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your \nlife. You can be sure \u2013 my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you, \nbut destroy your life without a word in a second. \n  \nI\u2019ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 \nhours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don\u2019t \nworry, it\u2019s very simple. Just google \u201ccrypto exchange\u201d or \"buy Litecoin\" and then it will \nbe no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon. \n  \nI strongly warn you against the following: \n* Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail. \n* Do not contact the police. I have access to all your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s, and as soon as I find out \nyou ran to the cops, videos will be published. \n* Don\u2019t try to reset or destroy your d\u0435vi\u0441\u0435s. As I mentioned above: I\u2019m monitoring all \nyour activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vid\u0435\u043es are \u0440ublished. \n  \nAlso, don\u2019t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it\u2019s impossible to identify me \nusing the provided \u0430ddr\u0435ss. \n  \nGood luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other. \nAnd some friendly advice: from now on, don\u2019t be so careless about your online security. \n \n",

I give individual and gathering treatment as well as training, \nevaluation, and scholastic screenings to help understudies with physical and mental handicaps, \namong others enrolled with the DHHS. \nAn enormous level of the understudies served by this psychological well-being unit have mental \nor co-horrible mental inabilities and need emotional wellness backing to find lasting success at \nthe college. Accordingly, the unit gives the expected emotional well-being support while seeing \nand surveying undiscovered college understudies with scholastic hardships through the scholarly \nscreening and evaluation process. Close to that, I am the overseer of the management, preparing, \nand coordination of Directing Brain research and Clinical Brain research graduate understudies \nof the US who have practicum at DHHS and APA-licensed school brain science predoctoral \nentry level positions. \nYou have gotten this email since you have a proposal from the College Office to work with me. \n \nWould it be a good idea for you to acknowledge the proposition you'll briefly go about as my \nown colleague while we assist understudies with handicaps who are disappointed with \nobliviousness and the absence of administrations. To fulfill any interest you could have, I care \nabout creature government assistance, expressions and culture, kids, social equality and social \nactivity, schooling, climate, catastrophe and philanthropic alleviation, social administrations, and \nparts more. \n \nThis is extremely straightforward work. You will just assist me with mailing a few letters, make \na couple of installments at Walmart, and buy a few things when required. This business just \nrequires an hour daily, 2-3 days per week, for $900 week after week. I can't get together for a \nmeeting since I'm currently away, helping handicapped understudies in Australia. By the way, \nyou will be paid ahead of time for all undertakings done for my sake. A portion of my \nletters/mail will be sent to your home or close by the mailing station for you to get up whenever \nthe timing is ideal. Upon my appearance, we will examine the chance of making this a drawn out \nwork in the event that I am dazzled with your administrations while I'm away. \nI received your email through a waitlist from the HR Division to give out positions to a couple of \nunderstudies at your college. The college knows about everything. \nMercifully give the underneath Data to apply: \n \nNames: \nAddress: \nTelephone Number: \nAge: \nElective email unique in relation to school email: \n \nAnticipating hearing from you soon.

I am very sick and \ndiagnosed, so i decided to financially support disability and less fortunate people. Give \n80% of the funds to disabilities and less fortunate people. The remaining 20% is for your \nefforts. I want to fulfill the vow i made with my late husband. I will give you more details \nas soon as i hear from you. \nDr. Mrs. Valerie Baptiste-Andrews \n \n",

I was assigned by my colleague to seek for a \nforeign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any \ndesignated bank abroad for the transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in \nyour country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account. \n \nThis amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our \nministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the \ncontract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the \nover-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds \nout the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this \nmoney can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the \nbeneficiary of the fund. \n \nAs government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the \nreason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can \nact as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be \nfor you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us. \n \nWe hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a \ndesignated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over \nthere on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money. \n \nPlease note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the \nsuccess and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security \nreasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose \nthis proposal and the entire transaction to anybody. \n \nWe are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on \nthis money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this \ntransaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest \nby sending a email to us including your bank name & address, account \nnumber,telephone number. \n \nNote that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this \ntransaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated. \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n \n \nMr.George Emeka Emerah \nDirector, Finance Mini of Agriculture. \nEmail:mrgeorgeemerah2@gmail.com \nMy Cellphone:+ 234-911-815-7020 \nWhattsapp:+ 234-911-815-7020 \n",

In light of this, tomorrow evening's class \nhas been cancelled. I want you all to be able to partake in the festivities if you so \nplease, plus I'm scared of traffic and don't want my car stuck in Dan Allen \novernight. This week was going to be Monday screening / Wednesday lecture \nanyway, so please watch the entirety of Treasure Planet before Wednesday's \nclass. It's such a magical film and well worth viewing as an adult. I will lecture on \nWednesday, and then we'll have our final discussion of the semester. If you need \nanything in the meantime, I'm an email away. \nIn kindness, \nM \nSee this post in context \n \nChange your forum digest preferences \nAre you reading this in an email?

He \nhas been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why. \nApparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic \nrigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was \ndiagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing \nto be sure we aren\u2019t missing anything else. I will keep you updated. \n  \nRegarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go \nto a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to \ngo for his exams? \n  \nThanks, \nMegan Coursey \n \n",

I wanted to reach out for two reasons. \nFirst, I submitted two forms a few months ago for two high impact activities, and wanted \nto see if they both got approved. I recall getting a response that I was approved for at \nleast one but wasn't sure if I was approved for both. Since there isn't a good way for me \nto check-that I know of- I wanted to reach out. Let me know if there is a way I can check \nmyself! \n \nSecond, I wanted to ask about potential credit for a high impact activity for a study I plan \non conducting this summer. Although it will count for course credit (CSC 498/499 \nIndependent Study), it will be a huge opportunity. I plan on developing a software that \nwill work as a browser extension (hopefully) and will be used as a phishing detection \ntool by leveraging AI. Since some phishing emails use prompt engineering to form well \nwritten phishing content that is harder to detect using traditional methods, my program \nwill seek to also use AI to detect if the email is AI generated. I am currently taking \nseveral online courses alongside my NCSU courses to prepare for this. I am also \nworking with a professor who works at IBM, so the idea is to use his connection and our \nwork together to put my name in IBM's works. Right now, I am working on submitting my \nproposal for the study, and then I will hopefully be admitted. If I do get admitted, could \nthis count towards a High Impact Activity since it is such an amazing opportunity? If not, \nI will likely apply for the UHP sponsored completion of the Developing Cultural \nCompetence Certificate in the May section. \n \nThank you, \nChloe Coursey \n \n",

Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022: \n  \nMay 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and \n2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my \nownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up \n  \nAugust 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and \n2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution. \n  \nSo our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly \n$70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the \nK1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This \nalso doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which \nfor me should have been around  $112,625. \n  \nThanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend. \nMegan \n \n",

He doesn't like us contacting his \nteachers, and while we encourage him to be independent in this regard, his anxiety \ndoes still occasionally hold him back from reaching out to teachers in some situations. \nNevertheless, it is our responsibility to ensure his anxiety and ADHD are under the best \ncontrol possible and that he is utilizing all available tools. \n  \nWe all understand that the responsibility for this situation lies entirely with Hayden. My \ngoal is simply to figure out what options are available to him so I can provide him with \nas many tools as possible to avoid it in the future. \n  \nThe problem is that Hayden did not realize there was going to be a History test \nyesterday (hence his poor grade). I asked how he was expected to know about the test. \nHe said it was posted in the Google Classroom stream but he keeps forgetting to read \nthat - instead he goes directly to his \"to do\" list and all assignments are posted there. \nWe discussed the importance of reading the stream each day, because even if it is \nmostly the same information as the to do list, even one piece of critical information (like \nthe announcement of the test), makes it worth reading daily.  \n  \nHis not reading the stream and going straight to the \"to do\" list is partly a function of his \nanxiety. Though it is under pretty good control thanks to medication and years of \ncognitive-behavioral therapy, it does still manifest in certain scenarios, one of which is \nhis getting his homework done. While he no longer races through homework, he does \nrace to get started on it, and has a major anxiety spike if faced with any delay prior to \nstarting. This definitely plays a role in him skipping the feed and going straight to the \"to \ndo\" list.  \n \nI\u2019m not making excuses for him; I just want you to understand in case you have any \nhelpful ideas. My question to you is whether there was any other way Hayden should \nhave known about the test. Did he miss an announcement in class? Was it posted \nelsewhere that he should have seen? \n  \nWe did discuss how he could better utilize his planner to help him remember to check \nthe stream. If the answer is simply that he needs to be better about checking the stream \nthen I think we have done all we can for the time being. I am hopeful that this situation \nwill reinforce the importance of checking all sources daily for critical information. \n  \nAs always, any additional thoughts or ideas you have are very much welcomed. Thank \nyou for reading such a lengthy email. \n  \nMegan Coursey \n \n",

Hope you all \nhave a great weekend! \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n_________________________________ \nHello everyone, \n  \nThis week is our last class of the volleyball session and the awards ceremony!  The kids have done a \ngreat job!  They have been learning how to bump, set, and spike the ball to each other and over the \nnet!  They're ready to hit the beach with their new skills this summer! \n  \nOur next session of tennis will begin on April 23rd.  We will build upon the skills we learned in volleyball, but \ntransition to using a racket instead of our hands.  The kids will be learning forehand, backhand, and overhand \nswings, all in an engaging and fun environment.   \n  \nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out to me.  Thank you, and have a great day! \n  \nGodfrey Griffin \nLionheart Fitness Kids \nPh: 951-347-1555 \nwww.lionheartfitnesskids.com \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nHiral Mehta & Hemant Patel, Owners \nThe Goddard School \n6600 Creedmoor Road \nRaleigh, NC 27613 \n(919) 787-5002 \nGoddardSchool.com \n  \n \n",

I have viewed many intro videos and already love this \ngroup!  Thanks for sharing your background, interests, and for some of you- your \nhumor!  I've also begun looking at your discussion posts.  Wow!  Thanks for making \nyour connections so personal and true.  I will usually end my reply with a question or \ntwo.  You do not need to answer those questions- those are to prompt further thinking. \nI believe this class began Monday, March 4.  That makes today day 3 of this class.  If \nyou have not yet uploaded your intro video or started your discussion post, make that a \npriority tomorrow.  Remember to reply to classmates, too.  My intent is to grade your \ndiscussion post once you have replied to 3 classmates.  I will use the discussion rubric \nposted in the Module 1 for grading. \nLastly for tonight, I'm trying to reply to questions as they come in.  That means \nsometimes I reply from my watch or phone.  I'm not very good at either!  I just want to \nget you an answer quickly.  My watch and phone replies are short and to the point.  I do \nnot text quickly, so I skip the niceties.  Please know that if I reply \"sure\" or \"okay\" or \"not \nyet\" that I also mean \"I hope you are having a wonderful day.  If there is anything else \nyou need, just let me know.\"  and all that jazz.  As you can tell, I'm much wordier on \nemails than on texts. \nPLEASE let me know what I can do to make this course better and more meaningful for \nyou!  We are in these next 8 weeks together and will all come out the other side better. \nCheri Ogden \n \n",

I think I have this figured out.  A team from AU put the AU Online \ncourse syllabus and outlines together, so this is confusing at first.  Hang with me! \nIn Module 0 you find Welcome and Course Overview which houses Syllabus A, \nSyllabus B, and Course Due Dates.  Course Due Dates has accurate dates \nfor generic assignments.  So IF we have an Hypothes.is assignment in Module 1, the \ndue date is given.  If there is not an Hypothes.is assignment in Module 1, you ignore \nthat due date.  Course Syllabus A is specific to our course and lists the assignments \ndue in each module, but it does not give dates.  So you need to cross reference the \nassignments listed in Syllabus A with Course Due Dates to see when each task is due. \nI'm sorry for the confusion.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.  \nCheri Ogden \n \n",

I'm not clear about the difference between the outline itself and the \"one page \nchecklist\" that goes in a separate tab of the LiveBinder. Is it just a difference of \nformat (checkboxes vs structured outline), or is there a content difference (and \nif so, what is that difference)? \n2. If you are able, would you please take a look at my outline to see if it has what you \nare looking for? I haven't written the paragraph to go with it yet, but please let me \nknow if the structure matches what you are looking for, and if I have generally \ncovered the information you are looking for in the outline. Here is the \nlink: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cr3qdJlmpcS1eosCXfm6Er6aSqAKl\nV9_SLGmm22Psic/edit?usp=sharing \n3.

Here is the link: https://www.livebinders.com/b/3582727 \na. Also related to the LiveBinder: I have split up the content of the \nassignments into different tabs for organization. Is that ok, or do the \nassignments need to be uploaded in the same documents they were \nsubmitted in via D2L? \n \nThank you for your help! \n \nSincerely, \nErin Coursey \n \nGet Outlook for iOS \n \n",
